                                                    of ḥadīth. However, it is widely accepted that he was born on a
                                                    Monday in the ‘Year of the Elephant’. Ibn Kathīr (d. 774) cites
                                                    eight varying opinions on the date of the Prophet’s birth: 2nd Rabīʿ
                                                    al-Awwal (held by Abū Maʿshar al-Sindī, Ibn ʿAbd al-Barr,

                                                    Muḥammad b. Jubayr b. Muṭʿim, Ibn Diḥya), 10th of Rabīʿ al-Awwal
                                                    (held by Ibn ʿAsākir, Abū Jaʿfar al-Bāqir, al-Shaʿbī), 12th of Rabīʿ
                                                    al-Awwal (held by Ibn Isḥāq), 17th of Rabīʿ al-Awwal (held by

                                                <p>The first records of the observation of Muḥammad’s birth as a
                                                    celebration day can be traced back to the late 6th/12th century when
                                                    a special public celebration was arranged in Mecca (Ibn Djubayr,
                                                    113). It was al-Khayzuran, the mother of Harun al-Rashid, who first
                                                    transformed the Prophet’s birthplace from a humble dwelling-house to
                                                    a place of prayer, attracting an increasing number of visitors (Ibn
                                                    Djubayr, Rihla, 114, 163; Snouck Hurgronje, 27). The early Mawlid
                                                    celebrations included elements of Sufi influence, such as animal
                                                    sacrifices, torchlight processions, public sermons, and a feast
                                                    (Schussman, 1998). According to the hypothesis of Nico Kaptein, the
                                                    Mawlid was initiated by the Fāṭimids (Katz, 2007). The earliest
                                                    mention of the Mawlid celebrations in any historical work comes from
                                                    the writings of Jamāl al-Dīn Ibn al-Ma’mūn, who died in 587 AH/1192
                                                    CE. Annemarie Schimmel asserts that the tendency to celebrate the
                                                    memory of the Prophet’s birthday on a larger and more festive scale
                                                    emerged first in Egypt during the Fāṭimid rule (Schimmel, 1985). The
                                                    Egyptian historian Al-Maqrīzī (d. 1442) describes one celebration
                                                    held in 1122, attended mainly by scholars and the religious
                                                    establishment, where sermons were given, sweets were distributed,
                                                    and the poorly received alms. Al-Maqrīzī also documented the
                                                    celebration of various birthdays by Shiʿites, including those of the
                                                    Prophet, ʿAli, al-Ḥasan, al-Ḥusayn, Fāṭimah, and the current ruler.
                                                    He also mentioned that the Faṭimid rulers used to have several
                                                    festive seasons throughout the year, including the Mawlid of the
                                                    Prophet (Al-Maqrīzī, al-Khiṭaṭ wal-Āthār).</p>

                                                <p>Over time, Mawlid celebrations evolved to include various practices
                                                    and customs, reflecting the Muslim world’s diverse cultural and
                                                    religious influences. Despite minor differences in time and place,
                                                    these celebrations have maintained the same general features. Laylat
                                                    al-Mawlid, Mawlid al-Nabawi, Mawlid, Mawlid al-Nabi al-Sharīf, and
                                                    Eid Milad-un-Nabi. The Mawlid holds great significance for many
                                                    Muslims, as it allows them to express their love and reverence for
                                                    the Prophet Muḥammad while engaging in acts of devotion, charity,
                                                    and communal bonding.</p>

                                                <p>Despite the dubious origins of the mawlid celebration, scholars from
                                                    the Sunni tradition have defended and promoted it. Al-Suyuti (d.
                                                    1505) argued that celebrating the Mawlid is permissible and
                                                    praiseworthy, as it fosters a love for the Prophet and promotes
                                                    unity among Muslims (Husn al-Maqsid fi Amal al-Mawlid). He reasoned
                                                    that any act that brings Muslims closer to the Prophet and
                                                    encourages them to follow his teachings is virtuous as long as it
                                                    does not contradict Islamic teachings. Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani (d.
                                                    1449) endorsed the practice, asserting (Fatḥ al-Bārī). He maintained
                                                    that the Mawlid could serve as an opportunity for Muslims to reflect
                                                    on the Prophet’s life and teachings and strengthen their religious
                                                    commitment.</p>

                                                <p>Conversely, scholars such as Ibn Taymiyya (d. 1328) and Ibn al-Qayyim
                                                    (d. 1350) have censured the practice, arguing that it constitutes an
                                                    innovation (bidʿa) and deviates from authentic Islamic teachings
                                                    (Al-Sabuni, 1992). They contend that the Qurʾān or the Hadith does
                                                    not support the Mawlid and is an illegitimate addition to Islamic
                                                    tradition. Ibn Taymiyya ruled that it was a reprehensible devotional
                                                    innovation and criticised those who celebrated the Mawlid out of a
                                                    desire to imitate the Christian celebration of Jesus’s birthday
                                                    (Majmu‘ Fatāwa, 18:367). Taj al-Din al-Fakihani (d. 1331), an
                                                    Egyptian Maliki, considered Mawlid a blameworthy innovation that was
                                                    either makruh or haram (Kaptein, 1993). He argued that there was no
                                                    basis for the celebration in the Qurʾān or Sunnah and that the early
                                                    scholars of the umma did not observe it. Al-Fakihani described the
                                                    Mawlid as a “bidʿa (innovation)” introduced by idolators and a
                                                    delight to which gluttons abandon themselves” (Mawrid Fī ʿAmal
                                                    al-Mawlid).</p>

                                                <p>Similarly, fellow Egyptian Maliki Ibn al-Haj al-Abdari also
                                                    considered Mawlid a blameworthy innovation that was either disliked
                                                    or prohibited (Katz, 2007). He noted that the Salaf never practised
                                                    the celebration (Katz, 2007). The Maliki scholar Al-Shāṭibī
                                                    considered Mawlid an illegitimate innovation (Katz, 2007). The
                                                    Andalusian jurist Abu ‘Abd Allah al-Haffar (d. 1408) opposed Mawlid,
                                                    noting that had the Sahaba celebrated it, its exact date would not
                                                    be a matter of uncertainty (Katz, 2007).</p>

                                                <p>In recent years, academic discourse on the Mawlid has focused on the
                                                    practice’s historical, theological, and cultural dimensions.
                                                    Scholars such as Jonathan A.C. Brown (2011) and Azyumardi Azra
                                                    (2004) have examined the historical development of the Mawlid and
                                                    its influence on Islamic thought and culture. These studies
                                                    highlight how the Mawlid has shaped religious expression and
                                                    identity in various Muslim societies.</p>

                                                <p>Research has explored how the Mawlid has influenced Islamic thought
                                                    and contributed to various theological and philosophical
                                                    perspectives. For example, scholars such as R. Michael Feener (2001)
                                                    have examined the role of the Mawlid in the evolution of Islamic
                                                    mysticism (Sufism) and the veneration of saints, demonstrating how
                                                    the celebration has contributed to the growth and diversification of
                                                    Islamic spiritual practices. The Mawlid has played a significant
                                                    role in shaping Islamic culture, particularly in the art realm.
                                                    Scholars such as Kristina Nelson (2002) have analysed the
                                                    development of Mawlid-related poetry, music, and other forms of
                                                    artistic expression, highlighting how the celebration has
                                                    contributed to the richness and diversity of Islamic cultural
                                                    heritage.</p>


                                                <p>Additionally, academic research has explored how the celebration of
                                                    Mawlid has evolved and how different Muslim communities have adapted
                                                    the practice to their cultural contexts (Geaves, 2000). For example,
                                                    scholars such as Usha Sanyal (1996) and Martin Van Bruinessen (1996)
                                                    have analysed the role of the Mawlid in shaping devotional practices
                                                    and religious expression in South Asia and Indonesia, respectively.
                                                    These studies demonstrate Mawlid practices’ diversity and
                                                    significance in various cultural and historical settings.</p>

                                                <p>The practice of Mawlid has been a subject of disagreement among
                                                    Muslim scholars and religious authorities. The disputes can be
                                                    broadly categorised into three main areas:</p>

                                                <p>Some scholars argue that the celebration is a legitimate expression
                                                    of love and reverence for the Prophet Muḥammad and is rooted in the
                                                    authentic Islamic tradition (Siddiqi, 1995). They cite examples of
                                                    the Companions of the Prophet celebrating his birth and argue that
                                                    the Mawlid serves as a reminder of the importance of the Prophet’s
                                                    life and teachings. Others consider the Mawlid an innovation and say
                                                    Islamic teachings do not sanction it (Iqtida’ al-sirāṭ al-mustaqīm).
                                                    These scholars maintain that the Prophet Muḥammad and his Companions
                                                    did not celebrate his birthday, and the practice was introduced
                                                    later by various Muslim rulers and societies. As such, they argue
                                                    that the celebration is an illegitimate addition to Islamic
                                                    tradition.</p>

                                                <p>Some scholars contend that the historical origins of the Mawlid need
                                                    to be more well-established and that the practice needs a clear
                                                    precedent in the early Islamic period. They argue that the Mawlid
                                                    emerged due to the influence of local customs and cultural practices
                                                    rather than being rooted in the authentic Islamic tradition (Geaves,
                                                    2000).</p>

                                                <p>In summary, the Mawlid has no basis in the Qurʾān and Sunna; its
                                                    origin is found in later ʼIsmāʻīlī Shīʿa festivals during the
                                                    Fāṭimid dynasty. Furthermore, as has been demonstrated, these
                                                    festivals in the Fāṭimid dynasty were not unique to the Mawlid; they
                                                    made festivals out of any possible date that could be considered
                                                    auspicious. So to argue as some do that the celebration of the
                                                    Mawlid is grounded within the Qurʾān and Sunna and that such
                                                    festivals bring one closer to Allah is to innovate in the religion.
                                                    Bidʿa refers to any newly invented practice in religion that is not
                                                    based on the Qurʾān, Sunnah, or the consensus of the companions of
                                                    the Prophet. The celebration of the Mawlid is a bidʿa because it is
                                                    a relatively recent development in Islamic history and has no basis
                                                    in the practice of the Prophet or his companions. Kaptein (1993)
                                                    summarises some valuable points when considering the legitimacy of
                                                    Mawlid: originally a Shiʻa celebration that started 500 years after
                                                    the death of the Prophet, the Fāṭimids did not always celebrate it
                                                    on the same date, the Fāṭimids used the festival to emphasis their
                                                    kinship with ahl al-Bayt was emphasised, to cultivate loyalty to the
                                                    Fāṭimid caliphate. Beyond these points, as Ibn Kathīr raised, there
                                                    are over eight different opinions on when the birth took place.
                                                    Thus, it is clear the origins of the celebration were political
                                                    displays, which have become displays cultural displays of Muslim
                                                    identity and ‘veneration’. However, this course leads to excessive
                                                    veneration of the Prophet, and as Ibn Taymiyya argued, is what the
                                                    Christians did with Jesus. God states in the Qurʾān,</p>

                                                    God is only one God, He is far above having a son, everything in the
                                                    heavens and earth belongs to Him, and He is the best one to trust”
                                                    (Q. 4:171).</p>


                                                <p>ʿUmar narrated that he heard the Prophet saying, “Do not exaggerate
                                                    in praising me as the Christians praised the son of Mary, for I am
                                                    only a Slave. So, call me the Slave of Allah and His Apostle” (Ṣaḥīḥ
                                                    al-Bukhārī, 3445).</p>

                                                <p>Ultimately, celebrating the Mawlid is a stepping stone to shirk as it
                                                    is a means by which Muslims follow the Christians in how they raised
                                                    Jesus above his status, but they raise Muḥammad above his. Arguments
                                                    which argue it is done out of love for the Prophet are genuinely
                                                    misplaced. The Prophet said, He also said, “Beware of exaggeration
                                                    in the religion, for those who came before you perished because of
                                                    their exaggeration in religion” (Sunan al-Nasā’ī, 3057). The Prophet
                                                    also said, “The evilest matters in religion are those that are newly
                                                    invented, for every newly invented matter is an innovation, every
                                                    innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Hellfire”
                                                    (Sunan al-Nasā’ī, 1578). God says on the topic,</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">وَمَن يُشَاقِقِ ٱلرَّسُولَ مِنۢ بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ ٱلْهُدَىٰ
                                                    وَيَتَّبِعْ غَيْرَ سَبِيلِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ نُوَلِّهِۦ مَا تَوَلَّىٰ
                                                    وَنُصْلِهِۦ جَهَنَّمَ ۖ وَسَآءَتْ مَصِيرًا ١١٥</p>

                                                <p>If anyone opposes the Messenger, after guidance has been made clear
                                                    to him, and follows a path other than that of the believers, We
                                                    shall leave him on his chosen path- We shall burn him in Hell, an
                                                    evil destination. (Q. 4:115).</p>

                                                <p>So how, then, can we follow the innovation of Mawlid and claim that
                                                    it is out of love for the Prophet when Allah and His Messenger
                                                    expressly prohibited innovation? Loving the Prophet is a duty for
                                                    every Muslim. However, this does not mean that one should introduce
                                                    new practices into the religion, as these are reprehensible
                                                    innovations. The best way to demonstrate love for the Prophet is to
                                                    obey and follow him; this is the most excellent form of love.
                                                    Keeping the Prophet’s Sunna alive and avoiding actions that go
                                                    against it is also an expression of love for him. Islam is based on
                                                    two principles: sincere intentions and following the Prophet.</p>

                                                <p>ʻUmar ibn al-Khattab reported that the Messenger of Allah said:</p>

                                                <p>“Verily, deeds are only with intentions. Verily, every person will
                                                    have only what they intended. Whoever emigrated to Allah and his
                                                    Messenger, his emigration is for Allah and his Messenger. Whoever
                                                    emigrated to get something in the world or to marry a woman, his
                                                    emigration is for that to which he emigrated” (Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī,
                                                    54).</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">وَمَن يُطِعِ ٱللَّهَ وَٱلرَّسُولَ فَأُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ مَعَ ٱلَّذِينَ

                                                <p>“Whoever obeys God and the Messenger will be among those He has

                                                    truth, and the righteous- what excellent companions these are!” (Q.
                                                    4:69).</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">بَلَىٰ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُۥ لِلَّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌۭ فَلَهُۥٓ

                                                <p>“In fact, any who direct themselves wholly to God and do good will
                                                    have their reward with their Lord: no fear for them, nor will they
                                                    grieve” (Q. 2:112).</p>


                                                <p>This means being sincere towards God and following the Messenger by
                                                    implementing his Sunna. Celebrating the Prophet’s birthday and
                                                    similar practices are considered innovations and are not
                                                    permissible.</p>

                                                <p>Furthermore, the date on which Mawlid is celebrated (12th of Rabīʿ
                                                    al-Awwal) is also the date most scholars consider the date the
                                                    Prophet passed away. Although, the exact date of the Prophet’s death
                                                    is disputed. There are different opinions regarding the month and
                                                    day of his passing. Most scholars believe that he passed away on the
                                                    12th of Rabīʿ al-Awwal. Al-Khwārizmī held the view that the Prophet
                                                    died on the 1st of Rabīʿ al-Awwal. Ibn al-Kalbi and Abu Makhnaf
                                                    believed that he died on the 2nd of Rabīʿ al-Awwal. Despite the
                                                    differing opinions, the most widely accepted view is that the
                                                    Prophet passed away on the 12th of Rabīʿ al-Awwal in the year 11 AH.
                                                    Thus, the celebration of Mawlid, which occurs on the 12th of Rabīʿ
                                                    al-Awwal, is a celebration on the day of his death; of all the
                                                    opinions regarding the date, the 12th of Rabīʿ al-Awwal is the
                                                    weakest and was supported by only a later historian.</p>

                                                <p>Consequently, it is strange that people would argue they love the
                                                    Prophet and follow the weakest historical position of his birth and
                                                    celebrate on this day despite it being almost unanimously the date
                                                    of the greatest tragedy which befell the Muslims, i.e., the death of
                                                    the Prophet. In doing so, these individuals disrespect the Prophet
                                                    and his legacy by inadvertently celebrating his death and causing
                                                    it, insofar as they are destroying the Sunna, promoting bidʿa and
                                                    creating doorways to shirk.</p>

                                                    to them) as contenders in this regard to Allah. They love them as
