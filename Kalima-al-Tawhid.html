                                            <div>

                                                <p>In the vast landscape of faith and practice, the kalimāt (Arabic:
                                                    كلمات, meaning “words”) serves as a distinctive array of signposts
                                                    guiding believers along the path of Tawḥīd. Chief among these
                                                    guiding phrases is the Fourth Kalimā, or Kalimā al-Tawḥīd, a
                                                    testament of faith encapsulating the essence of the worldview.</p>

                                                <p>The affirmation of Tawḥīd is at the heart of the faith. This
                                                    fundamental concept is declared emphatically in the Kalimā
                                                    al-Tawḥīd:</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">سُبْحَان اللهِ وَالْحَمْدُلِلّهِ وَلا إِلهَ إِلّااللّهُ وَاللّهُ
                                                    أكْبَرُ وَلا حَوْلَ وَلاَ قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِاللّهِ الْعَلِيِّ
                                                    الْعَظِيْم‎‎</p>

                                                <p>“lā ʾilāha ʾillā -llāhu waḥdahū lā sharīka lahū lahū l-mulku wa-lahū
                                                    l-ḥamdu yuḥyī wa-yumītu wa-huwa ḥayyun lā yamūtu ʾabadan ʾabadan ḏu
                                                    l-jalāli wa-l-ʾikrām bi-yadihi-l k͟hayr wa- huwa ʿalā kullī shayʾin
                                                    qadīr”</p>

                                                <p>“There is no deity but Allah alone and has no partners. To Him
                                                    belongs all sovereignty, and to Him belongs all Praise. He gives
                                                    life and causes death, and He is alive and does not die, ever! Ever!
                                                    He of Majesty and Munificence. In His hand is all goodness, and He
                                                    has power over everything.”</p>

                                                <p>This Kalimā, the Fourth of the Six Kalimās of Islam, is a profound
                                                    expression of the creed, a spiritual anchor for all Muslims, and a
                                                    vital part of the believer’s daily recitations. The Six Kalimās are
                                                    recorded neither in the Qurʾān nor the Ḥadīth in their present
                                                    compiled form (Halverson, 2010). They have gained widespread
                                                    acceptance due to their conciseness, clarity, and comprehensive
                                                    encapsulation of essential beliefs and for providing a foundational
                                                    understanding of the religion, especially for children and new
                                                    converts (Ahmed, 2005).</p>

                                                <p>The Fourth Kalimā is unique in its comprehensive articulation of the
                                                    core principles of Tawḥīd. This expression of monotheism is not
                                                    merely a simple declaration of the oneness of Allah. However, it
                                                    delves deeper into His singular attributes and rights, echoing the
                                                    resounding themes within the Qurʾān. Q. 112:1-4 provides an apt
                                                    parallel:</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ ١ ٱللَّهُ ٱلصَّمَدُ ٢ لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ
                                                    يُولَدْ ٣ وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُۥ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌۢ ٤</p>

                                                <p>“Say (O Muhammad): ‘He is Allah, (the) One. Allah-us-Samad (The
                                                    Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, He neither eats nor
                                                    drinks). He begets not, nor was He begotten, And there is none
                                                    co-equal or comparable unto Him”.</p>

                                                <p>The Fourth Kalimā reasserts the rejection of polytheism and
                                                    anthropomorphism in no uncertain terms, emphasising Allah’s
                                                    indivisible unity and singularity. In the words of Al-Ghazali,
                                                    Tawḥīd is the “essence of the testimony of faith… (al-maqṣād al-asna
                                                    fi sharah asma’ Allahu al-Ḥusna). which excludes all forms of
                                                    polytheism and insists on the absolute unity of the Divine.” This
                                                    concept forms the bedrock upon which the entire edifice of Islam is
                                                    erected. It sets it apart from other monotheistic traditions in its
                                                    insistence on the unmediated worship of Allah (Hallaq, 2009).</p>

                                                <p>The doctrine of Tawḥīd, representing the Unity of God, is the
                                                    linchpin of belief and the axis around which the entire cosmos of
                                                    thought and practice revolves. Tawḥīd, as a term, is derived from
                                                    the Arabic root word ‘waḥda,’ meaning ‘to unify’ or ‘to make one’
                                                    (El Sayed, 2011). However, the theological richness of Tawḥīd
                                                    transcends this linguistic interpretation, culminating in the
                                                    comprehensive affirmation of the Unity of God, both in His essence
                                                    (Ḏhāt) and in His attributes (Ṣifāt) (Maududi, 1997).</p>

                                                <p>In this connection, it is worth mentioning that the concept of Tawḥīd
                                                    is firmly grounded in the Qurʾān. The Qurʾān is resplendent with
                                                    verses that proclaim the Oneness of God in no uncertain terms, most
                                                    notably in Q. 112. This chapter, also known as the Essence of the
                                                    Qurʾān, provides the most succinct yet comprehensive articulation of
                                                    the Tawḥīd doctrine.</p>

                                                <p>At this juncture, it is worth delineating the three major categories
                                                    into which Tawḥīd is traditionally subdivided in theology: Tawḥīd
                                                    al-Rubūbiyya (Unity of Lordship), Tawḥīd al- Ulūhiyya (Unity of
                                                    Worship), and Tawḥīd al-Asmā’ wa’l-Ṣifāt (Izutsu, 2002). Tawḥīd
                                                    al-Rubūbiyya asserts the uniqueness of God as the sole creator,
                                                    Sustainer, and determiner of all that exists. This belief stems from
                                                    various Qurʾānic verses, such as Q. 6:102,</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">ذَٰلِكُمُ ٱللَّهُ رَبُّكُمْ ۖ لَآ إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ۖ خَـٰلِقُ
                                                    كُلِّ شَىْءٍۢ فَٱعْبُدُوهُ ۚ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍۢ وَكِيلٌۭ
                                                    ١٠٢</p>

                                                <p>Which states, “That is Allah, your Lord! There is no deity but He,
                                                    the Creator of all things”.</p>

                                                <p>Here, the emphasis is on the absolute sovereignty of God over the
                                                    entire cosmos. Tawḥīd al- Ulūhiyya, on the other hand, underscores
                                                    the notion that Allah alone deserves worship. Q. 51:56 affirms this,
                                                    saying:</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ ٱلْجِنَّ وَٱلْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ ٥٦</p>

                                                <p>“And I (Allah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they
                                                    should worship Me (Alone)”.</p>

                                                <p>In this light, all forms of worship, whether overt or subtle, must be
                                                    directed to Allah alone, void of intermediaries. Lastly, Tawḥīd
                                                    al-Asmā’ wa’l-Ṣifāt recognises the uniqueness of Allah’s names and
                                                    attributes, insisting that no creature can share in them. For
                                                    instance, Q. 7:180 notes:</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">وَلِلَّهِ ٱلْأَسْمَآءُ ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ فَٱدْعُوهُ بِهَا ۖ وَذَرُوا۟
                                                    ٱلَّذِينَ يُلْحِدُونَ فِىٓ أَسْمَـٰٓئِهِۦ ۚ سَيُجْزَوْنَ مَا
                                                    كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ ١٨٠</p>

                                                <p>“And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allah, so call on Him
                                                    by them”.</p>

                                                <p>This component of Tawḥīd reiterates that Allah’s attributes are
                                                    unlike those of His creation, thus rejecting any form of
                                                    anthropomorphism. Notably, these three categories are not
                                                    independent of one another but interlinked in a holistic framework.
                                                    Denial of one aspect inevitably leads to the collapse of the entire
                                                    construct of Tawḥīd, culminating in shirk or associating partners
                                                    with Allah – the most grievous sin in Islam (Nasr, 2002).</p>

                                                <p>Shirk is perceived as the opposite pole of Tawḥīd. It involves
                                                    ascribing partners to Allah in His Lordship, worship, or attributes.
                                                    Shirk originates from the Arabic root ‘sharika’ which signifies ‘to
                                                    associate’ or ‘to share’ (Wehr, 1979). Shirk represents the cardinal
                                                    sin of polytheism, associating partners with Allah in any form or
                                                    manner (Al-Qaraḍāwī, 1992). The Qurʾān explicitly emphasises the
                                                    severity of this sin, noting in Q. 4:48,</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِۦ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ
                                                    ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ ۚ وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدِ ٱفْتَرَىٰٓ
                                                    إِثْمًا عَظِيمًا ٤٨</p>

                                                <p>“God does not forgive the joining of partners with Him: anything less
                                                    than that He forgives to whomever He will, but anyone who joins
                                                    partners with God has concocted a tremendous sin.”</p>

                                                <p>This verse illustrates the unforgivable nature of shirk if one dies
                                                    without seeking repentance, reinforcing the principle of Tawḥīd.
                                                    Shirk typically manifests in three fundamental categories,
                                                    reflecting those of Tawḥīd: shirk in Allah’s Lordship (shirk
                                                    al-Rubūbiyya), shirk in Allah’s worship (shirk al-Ulūhiyya), and
                                                    shirk in Allah’s names and attributes (shirk al-Asmā’ wa’l-Ṣifāt)
                                                    (Al-Bāz, 2001).</p>

                                                <p>Shirk al-Ulūhiyya, also called the ‘shirk of worship,’ encompasses
                                                    directing any form of worship – prayer, fasting, sacrifice, or
                                                    reliance – to entities other than Allah. This form of shirk ranges
                                                    from the worship of idols, humans, or other creations to the subtler
                                                    forms of shirk, such as showing off in acts of worship (riyāʾ) or
                                                    giving precedence to cultural norms over divine commands (Khalidi,
                                                    2001).</p>

                                                <p>Shirk al-Asmā’ wa’l-Ṣifāt involves ascribing the names or attributes
                                                    of Allah to His creation or vice versa. This could be in deifying
                                                    humans or other entities and humanising Allah by attributing human
                                                    characteristics to Him, thereby blurring the boundary between the
                                                    creator and the created (Schimmel, 2013).</p>

                                                <p>While shirk might seem a distant concept in monotheistic societies,
                                                    it subtly pervades various aspects of life in forms that are not
                                                    immediately apparent. Cultural practices, for instance, often
                                                    involve shirk in the form of superstitions and rites attributing
                                                    supernatural powers to created beings or objects. Similarly, extreme
                                                    forms of nationalism or sectarianism that elevate a leader, a
                                                    nation, or a group to an inviolable status could be seen as shirk,
                                                    given the absolute loyalty and reverence they demand (Al-Buti,
                                                    2004).</p>

                                                <p>Notably, the Qurʾān addresses the notion of shirk as an affront to
                                                    human reason and natural disposition (fiṭra). It presents polytheism
                                                    not as a rational choice but as a cultural construct or a historical
                                                    aberration (Q. 30:30). It also emphasises the need for believers to
                                                    constantly seek refuge in Allah from inadvertently falling into
                                                    shirk due to its often subtle and insidious nature (Q. 3:191).</p>

                                                <p>Sura al-Ikhlāṣ is an epitome of the concept of monotheism, Tawḥīd.
                                                    Comprising just four verses, it is a compact and profound
                                                    declaration of God’s oneness, uniqueness, and transcendence. The
                                                    chapter begins with the verse: “Say (O Muhammad), ‘He is Allah,
                                                    (the) One'” (Q. 112:1). The verse, initiated by a command to the
                                                    Prophet Muhammad to proclaim God’s oneness, delineates the essential
                                                    nature of Allah as singular and unique. The term ‘Aḥad’, translated
                                                    as ‘One’, emphasises not just numerical oneness but a oneness that
                                                    precludes the existence of any comparable entity (El-Awa, 1982).</p>

                                                <p>The second verse, “Allah-us-Ṣamad,” introduces the term ‘Ṣamad’, a
                                                    word rich in connotations. While it is commonly translated as ‘the
                                                    Eternal Refuge’, its full semantic range is extensive, encompassing
                                                    meanings such as ‘the Sustainer of all’, ‘the Master who is obeyed’,
                                                    and ‘the Supreme Being upon whom all creatures depend for their
                                                    needs and desires (Izutsu, 2002).</p>

                                                <p>The third and fourth verses, “He begets not, nor was He begotten; and
                                                    there is none coequal or comparable unto Him,” present a categorical
                                                    denial of any form of divine progeny, asserting Allah’s eternal
                                                    pre-existence and post-existence. Furthermore, affirming His
                                                    incomparability refutes any form of anthropomorphism, safeguarding
                                                    His transcendence (Abdel Haleem, 2005).</p>

                                                <p>The brevity of Sura al-Ikhlāṣ belies its weighty theological content.
                                                    It is reported that the Prophet Muhammad once remarked that Sura
                                                    al-Ikhlāṣ is equivalent to one-third of the Qurʾān (Bukhari, 1997).
                                                    From an exegetical perspective, various traditions have delved into
                                                    the depth of Sura al-Ikhlāṣ. Traditionalist exegetes, like
                                                    al-Tabari, have underscored its affirmation of God’s absolute
                                                    oneness and its rebuttal of Christian Trinitarianism and Arabian
                                                    polytheism (Tabari, Jami’ al-Bayan ‘an Ta’wīl al-Qurʾān). Sufi
                                                    commentators, like Rūmī, have interpreted the Sura symbolically,
                                                    seeing in its verse’s metaphors for the soul’s journey towards
                                                    divine unity (Nicholson, 2004). Philosophical commentators, such as
                                                    Ibn Sina, employed Neoplatonic concepts to elaborate on God’s
                                                    absolute simplicity and necessity implied in the Sura (Goodman,
                                                    1992).</p>

                                                <p>The Sura also has a significant role in socio-cultural contexts. It
                                                    is invoked in diverse religious rituals, such as funerals, prayers,
                                                    and invocations for protection. It is often engraved on religious
                                                    architecture and calligraphy, reminding God of oneness (Grabar,
                                                    1987).</p>

                                                <p>The first part of the Fourth Kalimā, “Lā ʾilāha illa-llāh”, echoes
                                                    the Shahada, the Muslim declaration of faith, asserting the negation
                                                    of any deity except Allah. It underscores the emphasis on
                                                    monotheism, affirming that worship is due solely to Allah (Esposito,
                                                    1998). The following phrase, “waḥdahu lā sharīka lahu”, translates
                                                    as “He is alone and has no partner,” reiterates this monotheistic
                                                    belief by rejecting any form of polytheism or shirk, i.e.,
                                                    associating partners with Allah (Peters, 1994).</p>

                                                <p>“Lahul-mulku wa lahul-ḥamdu” ascribes both dominion and praise to
                                                    Allah, encapsulating His sovereignty over the universe and His
                                                    deservingness of all praise and gratitude. This recognition
                                                    resonates with several Qurʾānic verses, such as</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">تَبَـٰرَكَ ٱلَّذِى بِيَدِهِ ٱلْمُلْكُ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍۢ

                                                <p>“Blessed is He in whose hand is the dominion, and He is over all
                                                    things competent” (Q. 67:1).</p>

                                                <p>“Yuḥyī wa yumītu” acknowledges Allah’s power over life and death, a
                                                    motif frequently invoked in the Qurʾān, for instance,</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ لَا تَكُونُوا۟ كَٱلَّذِينَ

                                                    ١٥٦</p>

                                                <p>“You who believe, do not be like those who disbelieved and said of
                                                    their brothers who went out on a journey or a raid, ‘If only they
                                                    had stayed with us, they would not have died or been killed,’ for
                                                    God will make such thoughts a source of anguish in their hearts. God
                                                    gives life and death; God sees everything you do” (Q. 3:156).</p>

                                                <p>The statement underscores Allah’s ultimate control over the most
                                                    fundamental aspects of existence. The Kalimā concludes with “wa huwa
                                                    ‘alā kullī shay’in qadīr”, affirming Allah’s omnipotence. This
                                                    phrase, found in various iterations throughout the Qurʾān,
                                                    encapsulates the belief in God’s unbounded power and ability (Denny,
                                                    2006).</p>

                                                <p>The Fourth Kalimā is a statement of faith and a profound theological
                                                    assertion. It brings together critical beliefs: monotheism, the
                                                    negation of polytheism, God’s sovereignty, the power over life and
                                                    death, and omnipotence. These concepts are interrelated, each
                                                    elucidating an understanding of God (Murata and Chittick, 1994).</p>

                                                <p>The declaration also carries profound spiritual implications. The
                                                    continuous repetition of this Kalimā in daily invocations is
                                                    intended to imbue Muslims with a deep consciousness of God’s oneness
                                                    and His pervasive presence in every aspect of life (Haleem, 2010).
                                                    In this context, it is noteworthy that this Kalimā is recited in the
                                                    daily Salāt, during moments of distress, and at the time of death,
                                                    indicating its role in guiding Muslims’ spiritual journey (Turner,
                                                    1995).</p>

                                                <p>The Fourth Kalimā is a profound declaration of monotheism, asserting
                                                    Allah’s absolute unity and sovereignty. While this Kalimā is not
                                                    directly quoted from the Qurʾān, its concepts are firmly rooted in
                                                    the Ḥadīth literature, the sayings, and actions of the Prophet
                                                    Muhammad. As a primary source of jurisprudence and spiritual
                                                    guidance, Ḥadīth is crucial in elucidating and complementing the
                                                    Qurʾānic messages. They are practical examples of applying
                                                    principles, including the monotheistic doctrine embodied in the
                                                    Fourth Kalimā (Robinson, 2003). Multiple Ḥadīth illustrates the
                                                    Prophet Muhammad’s emphasis on the principles encapsulated in this
                                                    Kalimā, and the following analysis will draw on critical examples.
                                                </p>

                                                <p>One of the central themes of the Fourth Kalimā, “Lā ʾilāha illa-llāh,
                                                    waḥdahu lā sharīka lahu” (“There is none worthy of worship but
                                                    Allah, He is alone and has no partner”), is highlighted in the
                                                    Ḥadīth recorded by Imam Malik: “The best thing I [the Prophet] have
                                                    said, myself and the prophets before me, is: There is no god but
                                                    Allah, alone, without partner” (Muwaṭṭaʾ 504). This Ḥadīth
                                                    reinforces the concept of monotheism as the supreme principle shared
                                                    by all prophets, a critical tenet of the Fourth Kalimā.</p>

                                                <p>The part of the Fourth Kalimā, “lahul-mulku wa lahul-ḥamdu” (“His is
                                                    the dominion and His is the praise”), is echoed in a Ḥadīth recorded
                                                    in Al-Nasā’ī: “Allah’s Messenger used to say: ‘O Allah, Yours is the
                                                    praise, Yours is the dominion, to You is due gratefulness, and there
                                                    is no partner with You'” (An-Nasā’ī: 1133). This Ḥadīth reflects the
                                                    recognition of God’s ultimate sovereignty and the importance of
                                                    praising Him, as emphasised in the Fourth Kalimā.</p>

                                                <p>The statement “yuḥyī wa yumītu” (“He gives life and causes death”)
                                                    underlines Allah’s authority over life and death, as declared in the
                                                    Fourth Kalimā. The last part of the Fourth Kalimā, “wa huwa ‘alā
                                                    kullī shay’in qadīr” (“and He is over all things competent”),
                                                    reaffirms the omnipotence of God. A Ḥadīth narrated by Al-Nasāʾī
                                                    states, “The Prophet used to say frequently in his bowing and
                                                    prostrations ‘Subhanaka Allahumma Rabbana wa Bihamdika, Allahumma
                                                    Ighfirli’ [Exalted are You O Allah, our Lord, and with Your praise
                                                    (I bow and prostrate), O Allah, forgive me]” (Al-Nasāʾī 1123). This
                                                    Ḥadīth reflects the submission and humility before the all-powerful
                                                    God that the Fourth Kalimā seeks to instil.</p>

                                                <p>Delving deeper into the intricate relationship between the Fourth
                                                    Kalimā and the Ḥadīth, it becomes evident that a rich repository of
                                                    Ḥadīth provides nuanced insights into the monotheistic principles
                                                    embedded within this proclamation of faith. Following the previous
                                                    section, this analysis will elaborate on additional Ḥadīth that
                                                    underscore the Fourth Kalimā’s profound truths: Allah’s
                                                    uncompromising unity, His supreme sovereignty, and His ultimate
                                                    control over life and death.</p>

                                                    ʾilāha illa-llāh, waḥdahu lā sharīka lahu”, one could consider the
                                                    Ḥadīth recorded by al-Tirmiḏhī, in which the Prophet Muhammad is
                                                    reported to have said, “The best of supplications is the
                                                    supplication on the day of ‘Arafa, and the best of what I and the
                                                    Prophets before me have said is, ‘There is nothing worthy of worship
                                                    except Allah, alone, without partner. To Him belongs all sovereignty
                                                    and praise, and He is over all things omnipotent'” (Sunan
                                                    al-Tirmiḏhī̄3585). This Ḥadīth not only echoes the words of the
                                                    Fourth Kalimā but places them within the context of ‘Arafa.</p>

                                                <p>The statement “yuḥyī wa yumītu” is further illuminated in the Ḥadīth
                                                    recorded by al-Bukhari and Muslim, where the Prophet is reported to
                                                    have said, “Allah will hold the earth and roll up the heavens in His
                                                    right hand, then He will say, ‘I am the King. Where are the kings of
                                                    the earth?'” (Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī 6516). This Ḥadīth portrays Allah’s
                                                    ultimate power over life and death and the eventual annihilation of
                                                    worldly power, aligning with the sentiments of the Fourth Kalimā.
                                                </p>

                                                <p>Lastly, the phrase “wa huwa ‘alā kullī shay’in qadīr” finds its
                                                    resonance in a Ḥadīth reported by Abu Hurairah and recorded in Sahih
                                                    al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim, in which the Prophet Muhammad said,
                                                    “Allah says, ‘I am as My servant thinks of Me, and I am with him
                                                    when he remembers Me. If he remembers Me within himself, I remember
                                                    him within Myself. If he remembers Me in a gathering, I remember him
                                                    better (or greater). If he draws near to Me a hand span, I draw near
                                                    to him an arm’s length. Moreover, if he comes to Me walking, I go to
                                                    him running” (Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī 7405, Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim 2675). This
                                                    Ḥadīth encapsulates the omnipotence of Allah and His responsiveness
                                                    to His servants’ sincere efforts, reinforcing the Fourth Kalimā’s
                                                    closing statement.</p>

                                                <p>One of the most significant benefits of reciting the Fourth Kalimā is
                                                    its spiritual purification. As the Prophet Muhammad stated, “He who
                                                    dies knowing (and declaring) that there is no deity worthy of
                                                    worship, but Allah will enter Paradise” (Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim 26). In this
                                                    context, the repeated recitation of the Fourth Kalimā can be seen as
                                                    spiritual armour, protecting one’s faith and strengthening one’s
                                                    resolve during spiritual trials and tribulations.</p>

                                                <p>Moreover, the recitation

                                                    of the Fourth Kalimā also serves as an act of remembrance of Allah
                                                    (dhikr), which holds immense spiritual benefits. As Allah states in
                                                    the Qurʾān,</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">فَٱذْكُرُونِىٓ أَذْكُرْكُمْ وَٱشْكُرُوا۟ لِى وَلَا تَكْفُرُونِ ١٥٢
                                                </p>

                                                <p>“So, remember Me; I will remember you” (Q. 2:152).</p>

                                                <p>The constant remembrance of Allah through reciting the Fourth Kalimā
                                                    fosters a closer relationship with the Divine, inviting Allah’s
                                                    grace, mercy, and blessings. It promotes spiritual tranquillity and
                                                    peace, helping individuals to remain grounded in their faith amidst
                                                    the vicissitudes of life (al-Ghazali, 1998).</p>

                                                <p>In addition to spiritual benefits, reciting the Fourth Kalimā also
                                                    has profound psychological and emotional benefits. Its recurring
                                                    themes of divine unity, sovereignty, and power can serve as a source
                                                    of solace and comfort, providing individuals with the perspective
                                                    that their lives are under the control and decree of an
                                                    all-powerful, merciful deity. This belief in divine decree, or Qadr,
                                                    is one of the six articles of faith and can bring peace and
                                                    acceptance during adversity (Nasr, 2003).</p>

                                                <p>Scholars such as al-Ghazali have also posited that the recitation of
                                                    the Fourth Kalimā can act as a tool for combating spiritual maladies
                                                    like arrogance and self-delusion. By continually affirming Allah’s
                                                    supreme power and singularity, individuals are reminded of their
                                                    human limitations and the vanity of worldly pursuits, thus fostering
                                                    humility and gratitude (al-Ghazali, 1998).</p>

                                                <p>Reciting the Fourth Kalimā collectively affirms the community’s
                                                    shared faith and values regarding societal benefits. It reinforces
                                                    the bond of Muslim brotherhood and unity, underscoring the universal
                                                    message of Islam that transcends racial, ethnic, and cultural
                                                    differences (Esposito, 2002).</p>

                                                <p>Lastly, from a pedagogical perspective, the Fourth Kalimā serves as a
                                                    concise and practical summary of the fundamental doctrines, making
                                                    it an invaluable tool for teaching and learning about the faith. The
                                                    succinctness of its message makes it accessible and easily
                                                    understandable, even to new learners or converts to Islam (Murata &
                                                    Chittick, 2006).</p>

                                                <p>The Fourth Kalimā, with its fundamental themes of monotheism,
                                                    sovereignty, and the absolute power of Allah, has far-reaching
                                                    implications in the daily life of a Muslim. Its teachings echo
                                                    through various facets of life, instilling principles that guide
                                                    moral conduct, personal growth, interpersonal relationships, and
                                                    societal responsibilities. On a personal level, the recitation and
                                                    understanding of the Fourth Kalimā are constant reminders of the
                                                    impermanence of this worldly life and the ultimate reality of the
                                                    Hereafter. The Kalimā reaffirms that every life phase, hardship, or
                                                    ease is under Allah’s divine command. This understanding cultivates
                                                    a sense of resilience and patience, as exemplified in the Prophet
                                                    Muhammad’s life. He maintained steadfast faith in Allah during
                                                    trials, demonstrating the Qurʾānic teaching:</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">وَٱسْتَعِينُوا۟ بِٱلصَّبْرِ وَٱلصَّلَوٰةِ ۚ وَإِنَّهَا لَكَبِيرَةٌ
                                                    إِلَّا عَلَى ٱلْخَـٰشِعِينَ ٤٥</p>

                                                <p>“And seek help through patience and prayer, and indeed, it is
                                                    difficult except for the humbly submissive” (Q. 2:45).</p>

                                                <p>The Fourth Kalimā is also a beacon of hope and repentance.
                                                    Recognising Allah as the ultimate authority who “gives life and
                                                    causes death” reaffirms that His mercy is boundless. The Prophet
                                                    Muhammad said: “All the children of Adam constantly err, but the
                                                    best of those who constantly err are those who constantly repent”
                                                    (Sunan al-Tirmiḏhī 2499). This understanding nurtures a continuous
                                                    journey of self-improvement and spiritual growth.</p>

                                                <p>The Fourth Kalimā fosters humility, kindness, and compassion in
                                                    interpersonal relationships. The Kalimā recognises that all power
                                                    and glory belong to Allah alone, thus reducing arrogance and
                                                    promoting humbleness. The Prophet Muhammad exemplified this through
                                                    his own life, stating, “He who has in his heart the weight of a
                                                    mustard seed of pride shall not enter Paradise” (Muslim, 2007).</p>

                                                <p>Moreover, acknowledging Allah’s ultimate sovereignty reinforces the
                                                    Adl (justice) concept. As Allah is the final arbiter of justice in
                                                    the Hereafter, this inspires Muslims to uphold justice in their
                                                    daily interactions (Esposito, 2002). It discourages oppression,
                                                    encourages fair treatment of others, and prompts efforts to rectify
                                                    injustices, reflecting the Qurʾānic injunction:</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">۞ يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ كُونُوا۟ قَوَّٰمِينَ بِٱلْقِسْطِ

                                                <p>” You who believe, uphold justice and bear witness to God, even if it
                                                    is against yourselves, your parents, or your close relatives.
                                                    Whether the person is rich or poor, God can best take care of both.
                                                    Refrain from following your desire, so that you can act justly- if
                                                    you distort or neglect justice, God is fully aware of what you do”
                                                    (Q. 4:135).</p>


                                                <p>From a societal perspective, the Fourth Kalimā lays the foundation
                                                    for unity and cooperation. Affirming Allah’s oneness transcends
                                                    racial, ethnic, and socio-economic divisions, promoting a sense of
                                                    universal brotherhood among Muslims. It encourages collective
                                                    efforts towards societal welfare and harmony, manifesting in
                                                    practices like Zakat (almsgiving), one of the Five Pillars of Islam,
                                                    aimed at reducing economic disparities (Khan, 2010).</p>

                                                <p>Furthermore, recognising Allah as the ultimate source of bounty and
                                                    sustenance dissuades greed and fosters contentment and gratitude.
                                                    This contentment can counter materialistic tendencies and promote
                                                    sustainable living, aligning with the principle of Khilafa
                                                    (stewardship of the earth) (Khalid, 2002).</p>

                                                <p>Our exploration of the Fourth Kalimā, its theological underpinnings,
                                                    its manifestations in the Qurʾān and Ḥadīth, and its practical
                                                    applications in daily life underscores the Kalimā’s central role in
                                                    belief and practice. The profound precept it upholds – affirming
                                                    Allah’s oneness and absolute sovereignty – resonates throughout
                                                    every Muslim’s life. It permeates personal conduct, relationships,
                                                    societal responsibilities, and spiritual growth, reaffirming itself
                                                    as a comprehensive guide for leading a life aligned with principles.
                                                </p>

                                                <p>The Fourth Kalimā’s teachings echo the core tenets of Tawḥīd, the
                                                    unity of God, which is pivotal to the faith. By recognising Allah as
                                                    the sole entity worthy of worship, the Kalimā disavows shirk, the
                                                    act of associating partners with Allah. This theme, inherent in the
                                                    Fourth Kalimā, is profoundly manifest in the Sura Ikhlāṣ, a short
                                                    Qurʾānic chapter that encapsulates the essence of Tawḥīd. It further
                                                    underscores the significance of the Kalimā in fortifying the
                                                    monotheistic faith.</p>

                                                <p>The Fourth Kalimā’s importance is further emphasised through various
                                                    Ḥadīths, sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad. It forms an
                                                    essential part of the Prophet’s teachings, as seen in the Ḥadīth
                                                    collections of Sahih Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, and Jami` at-Tirmiḏhī.
                                                    These Ḥadīths not only elucidate the theological significance of the
                                                    Fourth Kalimā but also underscore its value in attaining Allah’s
                                                    forgiveness and favour. They point to the profound spiritual
                                                    benefits derived from its frequent recitation and deep
                                                    internalisation.</p>

                                                <p>The exploration of the Fourth Kalimā’s applications in daily life
                                                    presents it as a guiding light for Muslims in their earthly journey.
                                                    It cultivates resilience, patience, humility, compassion, and a
                                                    continuous journey towards self-improvement. It underscores the
                                                    importance of justice, unity, and sustainable living, aligning with
                                                    the broader principles of ‘Adl, Umma, and Khilafa. It prompts
                                                    Muslims to transcend their selves, working towards the collective
                                                    welfare of their communities and the environment.</p>

                                                <p>This analysis, while comprehensive, only scratches the surface of the
                                                    Fourth Kalimā’s profound depths. Further research could explore more
                                                    intricacies of its theological aspects, its interpretations among
                                                    different schools of thought, and its influences on art, culture,
                                                    and society. The Fourth Kalimā’s theological richness, its integral
                                                    presence in scripture and tradition, and its far-reaching impacts on
                                                    daily life make it a rich area for continued research and
                                                    reflection.</p>

                                                <p>The Fourth Kalimā stands as a cornerstone of the Islamic faith,
                                                    articulating the profound truth of Allah’s unparalleled unity and
                                                    serving as a beacon for Muslims worldwide. This powerful declaration
                                                    of faith intricately weaves the principles of Tawḥīd, the belief in
                                                    the singular nature of Allah’s essence and attributes, into the
                                                    fabric of Muslim spirituality.</p>

                                                <p>Rooted not in the Qurʾān but in the Hadith—sayings and actions
                                                    attributed to the Prophet Muhammad—this declaration finds its
                                                    strength and guidance. The Hadith breathe life into the Fourth
                                                    Kalimā, providing practical demonstrations of its principles and
                                                    cementing its vital role in the spiritual lives of the faithful.</p>

                                                <p>As a spiritual touchstone, the Fourth Kalimā offers Muslims a
                                                    constant reminder of their faith’s foundational principles. It
                                                    resonates in the daily Salāt, provides comfort in times of distress,
                                                    and accompanies believers into the afterlife. In moments of
                                                    spiritual need, it serves as a source of solace, direction, and a
                                                    beacon towards enlightenment and understanding.</p>

                                                <p>At its core, the Fourth Kalimā boldly rejects polytheism, anchoring
                                                    believers in the indivisible unity of Allah. It delineates Islam
                                                    from other belief systems, championing direct worship and
                                                    repudiating any association of partners with Allah. Tawḥīd stands as
                                                    the theological fulcrum of Islam, encapsulating the essence of
                                                    Muslim belief and practice.</p>

                                                <p>This belief in the Oneness of Allah transcends simple definitions,
                                                    unfolding into a holistic affirmation of divine unity in essence and
                                                    attributes. The Qurʾān abounds with verses proclaiming this unity,
                                                    with Chapter 112, Al-Ikhlāṣ, serving as a quintessential example.
                                                    This chapter crystallizes the concept of Tawḥīd, dividing it into
                                                    Tawḥīd al-Rubūbiyya (Unity of Lordship), Tawḥīd al-Ulūhiyya (Unity
                                                    of Worship), and Tawḥīd al-Asmā’ wa’l-Ṣifāt (Unity of Names and
                                                    Attributes), all of which coalesce to form the bedrock of Islamic
                                                    monotheism. To forsake any of these is to risk one’s faith and
                                                    engage in shirk, the gravest sin in Islam.</p>

                                                <p>The Fourth Kalimā finds its echo in Sura Al-Ikhlāṣ, a potent chapter
                                                    of the Qurʾān that unequivocally declares Allah’s unique oneness and
                                                    refutes any notion of divine comparability or offspring. Esteemed as
                                                    a third of the Qurʾān’s spiritual essence, this chapter has
                                                    captivated thinkers across ages.</p>

                                                <p>The Fourth Kalimā transcends its spiritual dimensions, permeating the
                                                    psychological and emotional spheres of life. It is a wellspring of
                                                    comfort, offering believers insight into the divine will and
                                                    alleviating spiritual afflictions. It cultivates humility,
                                                    encourages continual personal development, and fosters a community
                                                    united by shared faith and values.</p>

                                                <p>This declaration of faith aligns believers with the principles of
                                                    justice, unity, and sustainability, reminding them of their
                                                    responsibilities to the global community of believers and the world
                                                    they inhabit. It breaks down divisive barriers, fostering a
                                                    universal brotherhood amongst Muslims and advocating for societal
                                                    welfare, as exemplified by the practice of Zakat.</p>

                                                <p>As Muslims journey through life’s complexities, the Fourth Kalimā
                                                    serves as a guiding light, shaping their moral conduct, personal
                                                    development, and societal obligations. It reminds them of the
                                                    transience of worldly life and the ultimate reality of the
                                                    Hereafter, encouraging resilience, patience, and continuous
                                                    self-improvement.</p>

                                                <p>The teachings of the Fourth Kalimā, deeply rooted in the principles
                                                    of Tawḥīd, guide believers away from shirk, affirming the unique
                                                    oneness of Allah. This is beautifully encapsulated in Sura
                                                    Al-Ikhlāṣ, a chapter that embodies the essence of monotheistic
                                                    faith.</p>

                                                <p>The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, underscored the importance
                                                    of the Fourth Kalimā, teachings preserved in the Hadith that
                                                    highlight the spiritual benefits of this declaration, guiding
                                                    believers towards divine mercy and grace.</p>

                                                <p>In embracing the Fourth Kalimā, believers find a source of strength,
                                                    a compass guiding them towards resilience, patience, and compassion.
                                                    It calls them to a life of reflection, self-transcendence, and
                                                    active contribution to community welfare. The Fourth Kalimā stands
                                                    as a reservoir of wisdom, offering guidance and illumination in
                                                    life’s journey, urging believers to live in harmony with faith,
                                                    unity, and compassion. It continues to light the path and guide the
                                                    steps of the faithful towards a world resplendent with grace and
                                                    harmony.</p>
