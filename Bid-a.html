                                            <div>


                                                <p>The concept of ‘bidʿa’ (بدعة(, often translated as ‘innovation’,
                                                    holds a pivotal place in Islamic jurisprudence, encapsulating the
                                                    tensions between tradition and change within the Muslim religious
                                                    practice. The term derives from the Arabic root ‘b-d-ʿa”, which
                                                    means to begin something without precedent. Within Islamic
                                                    discourse, ‘bidʿa’ is utilised to categorise practices or beliefs
                                                    introduced into the religion that were not present during the time
                                                    of the Prophet Muhammad. The Quran does not explicitly mention
                                                    ‘bidʿa’ in the context of religious innovation, yet its ethos
                                                    significantly informs the later Islamic understanding of the term.
                                                    The Quranic worldview is rooted in the idea of a singular,
                                                    unchanging divine message, as seen in Surah Al-Ahzab,</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">سُنَّةَ ٱللَّهِ فِى ٱلَّذِينَ خَلَوْا۟ مِن قَبْلُ ۖ وَلَن تَجِدَ
                                                    لِسُنَّةِ ٱللَّهِ تَبْدِيلًۭا ٦٢</p>

                                                <p>“That was the Way of Allah in the case of those who passed away of
                                                    old, and you will not find any change in the Way of Allah” (Q.
                                                    33:62).</p>

                                                <p>While the Quran does not directly address ‘bidʿa’ in the context of
                                                    religious innovation, its principles lay the groundwork for later
                                                    interpretations. The Quranic ethos advocates for steadfastness in
                                                    following the divine message, as evident in verses that emphasise
                                                    adherence to established practices and warn against deviating from
                                                    them. Surah Al-Imran states,</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">وَمَن يَبْتَغِ غَيْرَ ٱلْإِسْلَـٰمِ دِينًۭا فَلَن يُقْبَلَ مِنْهُ
                                                    وَهُوَ فِى ٱلْـَٔاخِرَةِ مِنَ ٱلْخَـٰسِرِينَ ٨٥</p>

                                                <p>“And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be
                                                    accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers”
                                                    (Q. 3:85).</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">وَإِن تُطِعْ أَكْثَرَ مَن فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ يُضِلُّوكَ عَن سَبِيلِ
                                                    ٱللَّهِ ۚ إِن يَتَّبِعُونَ إِلَّا ٱلظَّنَّ وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلَّا
                                                    يَخْرُصُونَ ١١٦</p>

                                                <p>“And if you obey most of those on earth, they will mislead you far
                                                    away from Allah’s Path. They follow nothing but conjectures, and
                                                    they do nothing but lie” (Q. 6:116).</p>

                                                <p>In Surah Al-Rum, the division of religion into sects is criticized,
                                                    which scholars like Sayyid Qutb in “Fi Zilal al-Quran” interpret as
                                                    a warning against innovations leading to division,</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ فَرَّقُوا۟ دِينَهُمْ وَكَانُوا۟ شِيَعًۭا ۖ كُلُّ
                                                    حِزْبٍۭ بِمَا لَدَيْهِمْ فَرِحُونَ ٣٢</p>

                                                <p>“Of those who split up their religion (i.e. who left the true Islamic
                                                    Monotheism) and became sects, [i.e. they invented new things in the
                                                    religion (Bid’a), and followed their vain desires], each sect
                                                    rejoicing in that which is with it” (Q. 30:32).</p>

                                                <p>The Ḥadīth corpus provides a more direct elucidation of ‘bidʿa’. A
                                                    frequently cited Ḥadīth, “The evilest matters in religion are those
                                                    that are newly invented, for every newly invented matter is an
                                                    innovation, every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance
                                                    is in the Hellfire” (Sunan al-Nasā’ī, 1578). This Ḥadīth forms the
                                                    cornerstone of the traditionalist argument against religious
                                                    innovation. However, a critical examination reveals varied
                                                    interpretations among Islamic scholars.</p>

                                                <p>The Quranic verses and Ḥadīths related to ‘bidʿa’ reveal a layered
                                                    and multifaceted concept. The Quran’s emphasis on following the
                                                    divine guidance and avoiding division provides a basis for the later
                                                    elaboration of ‘bidʿa’ in Ḥadīth literature. The Ḥadīths themselves,
                                                    while seemingly straightforward, are subject to varying
                                                    interpretations by scholars across Islamic history.</p>

                                                <p>Prominent classical scholars have engaged deeply with the concept of
                                                    ‘bidʿa’. Imam Al-Shafi’i (150–204 AH/767–820 CE), a foundational
                                                    figure in Islamic jurisprudence, distinguished between ‘bidʿa
                                                    Ḥasana’ (commendable innovation) and ‘bidʿa sayi’a’ (reprehensible
                                                    innovation), a categorisation not explicitly found in the Quran or
                                                    Ḥadīth but derived through ijtihād (independent reasoning). This
                                                    distinction is pivotal in understanding the multifaceted nature of
                                                    ‘bidʿa’ in Islamic thought. For instance, Al-Shafi’i’s
                                                    categorisation is referenced in his seminal work, “Al-Risala”
                                                    (Al-Shafi’i, “Al-Risala”, trans. Majid Khadduri, 1987). Imam Malik
                                                    ibn Anas (93–179 AH/711–795 CE), another towering figure in Islamic
                                                    jurisprudence, reportedly viewed ‘bidʿa’ as an expansive concept,
                                                    encompassing both positive and negative manifestations, depending on
                                                    their alignment with the Quran and Sunna (Malik ibn Anas,
                                                    “Al-Muwatta”, 1989). This perspective underscores the importance of
                                                    aligning innovations with the foundational texts of Islam.</p>


                                                <p>In later Islamic thought, the concept of ‘bidʿa’ underwent further
                                                    elaboration and diversification. Ibn Taymiyya (1263–1328 CE), for
                                                    example, adopted a stringent stance against most forms of ‘bidʿa’,
                                                    arguing that the early generations of Muslims (Salaf) did not
                                                    practice them, thus they should be avoided (Ibn Taymiyya, “Majmu’
                                                    al-Fatāwā”, 1988). This perspective is often cited in contemporary
                                                    Salafist discourses against religious innovation. Conversely, Sufi
                                                    interpretations, as seen in the works of scholars like Al-Ghazali
                                                    (1058–1111 CE), often embraced certain types of ‘bidʿa’ that were
                                                    seen as enhancing spiritual experience and devotion, provided they
                                                    did not contradict the Quran and Sunna (Al-Ghazali, “Ihya’ ‘Ulum
                                                    al-Din”, 1981). In contemporary academic discourse, the discussion
                                                    of ‘bidʿa’ often intertwines with broader themes of Islamic legal
                                                    theory and the dynamism of Islamic jurisprudence. Wael B. Hallaq, in
                                                    “A History of Islamic Legal Theories” (1997), provides a nuanced
                                                    analysis of the development of legal theories surrounding ‘bidʿa’,
                                                    highlighting the adaptability and interpretative nature of Islamic
                                                    legal thought. Similarly, Sherman A. Jackson, in “Islamic Law and
                                                    the State” (1996), explores the role of ‘bidʿa’ in the context of
                                                    state power and legal authority in Islamic history, offering
                                                    insights into the political dimensions of religious innovation.</p>

                                                <p>The conservative approach to ‘bidʿa’ (innovation) in Islamic
                                                    jurisprudence often draws heavily on the interpretations of medieval
                                                    scholars, most notably Ibn Taymiyya. A hallmark of Ibn Taymiyya’s
                                                    jurisprudence is his firm stance against any religious innovation,
                                                    premised on the belief that such practices represent a deviation
                                                    from the authentic teachings of Islam as practised by the Prophet
                                                    Muhammad and his companions. In his comprehensive work “Majmu’
                                                    al-Fatawa,” Ibn Taymiyya presents a detailed exposition of this
                                                    view, arguing that the introduction of any new practice in religion
                                                    not explicitly sanctioned by the Quran and Sunna leads to
                                                    misguidance (Ibn Taymiyya, Taqi ad-Din Ahmad. “Majmu’ al-Fatawa”.
                                                    Riyadh: Dar Alam al-Kutub, 1991). Central to the conservative
                                                    viewpoint is a literal interpretation of certain Ḥadīths that
                                                    categorically condemn innovation. One of the most frequently cited
                                                    Ḥadīths in this context is “Kullu bidʿa’tin ḍalālah” (Every
                                                    innovation is a misguidance). This Ḥadīth, interpreted in its most
                                                    literal and broad sense, serves as a foundational principle for
                                                    conservative scholars. It is used to argue that any deviation from
                                                    the practices established during the Prophet’s era, regardless of
                                                    its intention or outcome, is inherently misguided and, therefore,
                                                    unacceptable.</p>

                                                <p>Conservative scholars maintain that the Islamic tradition established
                                                    by the Quran and Sunna is complete and perfect. They argue that this
                                                    perfection renders any addition or modification unnecessary and
                                                    potentially harmful to the purity of the faith. For these scholars,
                                                    strict adherence to the practices of the Prophet and his companions
                                                    is paramount. They assert that this adherence safeguards the Muslim
                                                    community from fragmentation and ensures the preservation of Islam
                                                    in its original form. The conservative approach, thus, places
                                                    significant emphasis on the early generations of Muslims (the Salaf)
                                                    as the ideal standard for Islamic practice.</p>

                                                <p>This perspective has led conservative scholars to critique
                                                    contemporary practices they view as ‘bidʿa’. These include religious
                                                    ceremonies like the celebration of Mawlid and certain societal
                                                    customs and uses of modern technology that have been integrated into
                                                    religious practices. The conservative viewpoint is often
                                                    characterised by vigilance against what is perceived as the creeping
                                                    influence of non-Islamic traditions and modern innovations into the
                                                    realm of religious observance.</p>

                                                <p>In the modern context, the conservative interpretation of ‘bidʿa’
                                                    presents both a bastion of tradition and a challenge in the face of
                                                    evolving societal needs. While it is lauded by its proponents for
                                                    preserving the original purity of Islamic practices, it also faces
                                                    criticism for its potential inflexibility and resistance to change,
                                                    even in matters unrelated to core religious beliefs or rituals.
                                                    Conservative Islamic scholars maintain a stringent stance against
                                                    ‘bidʿa’, grounded in the belief that the Islamic tradition, as
                                                    established during the Prophet Muhammad’s time, represents a
                                                    complete and perfect system of religious practice. This viewpoint
                                                    posits that the Quran and Sunna provide comprehensive guidance for
                                                    all religious and moral life aspects.</p>

                                                <p>Central to this argument is that the Prophet Muhammad’s life and
                                                    teachings constitute an ideal and flawless model for Muslims. Since
                                                    his practices were divinely guided, any addition or alteration to
                                                    these practices is deemed unnecessary and is viewed with suspicion.
                                                    This perspective is reinforced by Ḥadīths such as “Kullu bidʿa’tin
                                                    ḍalālah” (Every innovation is misguidance), which are interpreted to
                                                    mean that any deviation from the established practice is an error
                                                    (Ibn Taymiyya, Taqī ad-Din Ahmad. “Majmu’ al-Fatāwā”). Conservative
                                                    scholars assert that Islamic law (Sharīʿa), derived from the Quran
                                                    and Sunna, is all-encompassing and timeless. It provides sufficient
                                                    guidance for any situation or challenge, rendering innovations
                                                    redundant and potentially misleading. A key concern in the
                                                    conservative argument against ‘bidʿa’ is the potential for
                                                    subjective interpretations of Islam, which could lead to
                                                    fragmentation within the Muslim community.</p>

                                                <p>1. Subjective Interpretations: Allowing ‘bidʿa’, according to
                                                    conservative scholars, opens the door to personal or cultural
                                                    interpretations of religious practices. This subjectivity could
                                                    result in practices more aligned with individual or societal
                                                    preferences rather than with the authentic teachings of Islam.</p>

                                                <p>2. Potential for Deviation: There is a worry that once ‘bidʿa’ is
                                                    accepted, it could set a precedent for further deviations from the
                                                    original teachings of Islam. Over time, this could lead to
                                                    significant alterations in religious practice, potentially diluting
                                                    or distorting the essence of the faith.</p>

                                                <p>3. Historical Precedents: Conservative scholars often cite historical
                                                    instances where religious innovations led to sectarianism and
                                                    division within the Muslim community. They argue that adhering
                                                    strictly to the practices established during the Prophet’s time is
                                                    crucial to prevent such fragmentation.</p>

                                                <p>While conservative scholars advocate for strict adherence to the
                                                    Quran and Sunna, they recognise the role of ijtihād in Islamic
                                                    jurisprudence. However, they emphasise that ijtihād should be
                                                    exercised within the boundaries set by the primary sources and
                                                    should not introduce new practices that have no basis in these
                                                    sources.</p>

                                                <p>Ijtihād, in the conservative view, is a tool for interpreting and
                                                    applying the principles of the Quran and Sunna to new situations
                                                    rather than a means for introducing new practices or beliefs. The
                                                    exercise of ijtihād is bounded by the Quran’s and Sunna’s
                                                    overarching principles. It is acceptable only when it helps
                                                    understand and implement Islam’s teachings more effectively without
                                                    deviating from the established norms.</p>


                                                <p>The concept of ‘Religious innovation’ in Islamic theology pertains to
                                                    practices or beliefs adopted as religious that are not prescribed by
                                                    Allah. This discussion evaluates the theological implications of
                                                    engaging in or promoting such practices, particularly how they are
                                                    viewed within Islamic jurisprudence. ‘Religious innovation’ refers
                                                    to introducing religious practices or beliefs not sanctioned by
                                                    divine command. These innovations are often considered acts of
                                                    ‘bidʿa’ and can involve either adding new practices to the religion
                                                    or altering existing ones. This concept is particularly relevant
                                                    when individuals consider certain acts as bringing them closer to
                                                    Allah, which are not grounded in the Quran or Sunna. The core of
                                                    this issue lies in contravening direct divine command as stipulated
                                                    in the Quran and Sunna. Islamic theology holds that religious
                                                    practices and beliefs should strictly align with what is ordained by
                                                    Allah. Any deviation from this, whether through modification or
                                                    invention of religious practices, is seen as creating a form of
                                                    religion not authorised by Allah.</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">أَمْ لَهُمْ شُرَكَـٰٓؤُا۟ شَرَعُوا۟ لَهُم مِّنَ ٱلدِّينِ مَا لَمْ

                                                <p>“How can they believe in others who ordain for them things which God

                                                    the final decision. The evildoers will have a grievous punishment”
                                                    (Q. 42:21).</p>

                                                <p>A pertinent example is provided in the Quran in Surah Al-Tawbah where
                                                    Allah criticizes the People of the Book for taking their rabbis and
                                                    monks as lords besides Allah,</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">ٱتَّخَذُوٓا۟ أَحْبَارَهُمْ وَرُهْبَـٰنَهُمْ أَرْبَابًۭا مِّن دُونِ

                                                <p>“They (Jews and Christians) took their rabbis and their monks to be
                                                    their lords besides Allah (by obeying them in things which they made
                                                    lawful or unlawful according to their desires without being ordered
                                                    by Allah), and (they also took as their Lord) Messiah, son of Maryam
                                                    (Mary), while they (Jews and Christians) were commanded [in the
                                                    Taurat (Torah) and the Injīl (Gospel)) to worship none but One Ilah
                                                    (God – Allah) La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be

                                                    from having the partners they associate (with Him)” (Q. 9:31).</p>

                                                <p>This verse is interpreted to mean that obeying religious leaders in
                                                    matters that contradict Allah’s command is akin to attributing
                                                    divine authority to them. This analogy is reinforced in Ḥadīth
                                                    literature, where Prophet Muhammad clarifies that obeying religious
                                                    leaders in matters that contravene divine command is tantamount to
                                                    worshipping them (Tirmidhi and Musnad Ahmad). Individuals who follow
                                                    or propagate an innovated form of religion, thereby attributing to
                                                    themselves or others a share in divine authority, are considered to
                                                    have deviated from the monotheistic foundation of Islam. However,
                                                    Islamic jurisprudence differentiates between intentional fabrication
                                                    and actions borne out of misunderstanding. The latter may be
                                                    forgiven, provided the individual’s actions do not become a source
                                                    of misguidance for others.</p>

                                                <p>“The idolaters will say, ‘If God had willed, we would not have
                                                    ascribed partners to Him- nor would our fathers- or have declared
                                                    anything forbidden.’ In the same way, those before them continually
                                                    denied [the truth] until they tasted Our punishment. Say, ‘Have you
                                                    any knowledge that you can show us? You follow only supposition and
                                                    tell only lies.'” (Q. 6:148).</p>

                                                <p>Upon careful analysis, it becomes evident that numerous detrimental
                                                    consequences are associated with innovations. These harmful effects
                                                    should not be overlooked or underestimated, as they have the
                                                    potential to significantly impact various aspects of our lives and
                                                    society as a whole. It is essential to delve deeper into these
                                                    innovations’ negative implications to understand their challenges
                                                    comprehensively and explore potential solutions to mitigate their
                                                    adverse effects. We can gain a deeper knowledge by critically
                                                    examining the drawbacks and considering alternative approaches. For
                                                    instance,</p>

                                                <p>1. Innovations in religious practices, such as assigning specific
                                                    days for fasting or prayers, can lead to secondary effects like
                                                    extravagance and misplaced beliefs. For example, the innovation of
                                                    Salat al-Raghaib involves additional customs like feasting and
                                                    extravagant dressing, which may detract from the spiritual essence
                                                    of the practice.</p>

                                                <p>2. Many innovations stem from the erroneous belief that certain days
                                                    or practices hold special merit. This misconception leads to
                                                    prioritising certain practices over others, which should have been
                                                    endorsed by the Prophet Muhammad, potentially skewing the balance of
                                                    religious observance.</p>

                                                <p>3. Every act of innovation in Islam is typically associated with some
                                                    form of false belief or error, leading individuals away from the
                                                    authentic teachings of Allah. These beliefs often manifest as undue
                                                    reverence for non-sanctioned acts, adversely affecting one’s
                                                    spiritual state.</p>

                                                <p>4. Innovations can induce a false respect for certain practices which
                                                    lack any legitimate basis in Islam. Even if an individual does not
                                                    explicitly believe in the superiority of an innovative act, treating
                                                    it as a form of worship can implant a deep-seated reverence that
                                                    conflicts with true Islamic belief.</p>

                                                <p>5. Innovations are seen as contradictory to the faith practised and
                                                    preached by the Prophet Muhammad. They often result in a form of
                                                    hypocrisy, however slight, as practitioners of innovations may find
                                                    themselves torn between obedience to the Prophet and their
                                                    inclinations.</p>

                                                <p>6. The practitioners of innovations are likened to esteemed figures
                                                    like Abu Jahl and Abdullah Ibn Ubayy for their worldly status
                                                    despite their opposition to the Prophet. This comparison underscores
                                                    the dilemma faced by those engaging in innovations caught between
                                                    genuine religious observance and personal or societal pressures.</p>


                                                <p>Now that we have grasped a basic definition, we should explore some
                                                    historical developments around bidʿa. The period of the Prophet
                                                    Muhammad and the immediate years following his demise represent a
                                                    crucial phase in Islamic history for understanding the concept of
                                                    ‘bidʿa’. During the lifetime of the Prophet Muhammad, the idea of
                                                    ‘bidʿa’ was primarily understood in the context of maintaining the
                                                    purity and authenticity of the newly established Islamic faith. As
                                                    recorded in Ḥadīth collections, the Prophet’s teachings often
                                                    adhered strictly to the revelations and his Sunna. A key Ḥadīth
                                                    “Whoever introduces into this matter of ours that which does not
                                                    belong to it, it will be rejected.” (Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī 2697, Ṣaḥīḥ
                                                    Muslim 1718), highlights the Prophet’s caution against innovations
                                                    in religious matters. Contextual Implementation: Instances from the
                                                    Sīra demonstrate his approach to ‘bidʿa’. For example, the Prophet’s
                                                    acceptance of differing Qira’at showcases flexibility within the
                                                    framework of divine revelation.</p>

                                                <p>Following the Prophet’s death, the Al-Khulafā’ Al-Rāshidūn faced the
                                                    challenge of governing an expanding Muslim community while remaining
                                                    faithful to the Prophetic tradition. Caliph Abu Bakr’s Approach: Abu
                                                    Bakr’s tenure was marked by his commitment to preserving the Quran
                                                    and Sunna. His stance against apostasy and his decision to compile
                                                    the Quran into a single book reflects his efforts to prevent ‘bidʿa’
                                                    in religious practices. ʾUmar ibn Al-Khattab, known for his
                                                    administrative acumen, introduced several practices (considered
                                                    ‘bidʿa Ḥasana’, promising innovations) such as compiling the Islamic
                                                    calendar and establishing the Tarawih prayers in congregation. His
                                                    actions demonstrate a pragmatic approach to ‘bidʿa’, aligning with
                                                    the spirit of Islam while addressing contemporary needs.</p>

                                                <p>Classical and contemporary scholars have analysed this period to
                                                    understand the early Muslim community’s approach to ‘bidʿa’.
                                                    Scholars like Ibn Al-Jawzi in “Talbis Iblis” examins the early
                                                    community’s efforts to preserve the purity of Islamic teachings
                                                    while being responsive to the needs of a growing Ummah. Modern
                                                    academics like Khaled Abou El Fadl in “Speaking in God’s Name:
                                                    Islamic Law, Authority and Women” offer a revaluation of the concept
                                                    of ‘bidʿa’, arguing that the early Muslim community was more dynamic
                                                    and adaptive than often portrayed in traditional narratives.</p>

                                                <p>The Prophetic era and the period of the Rightly Guided Caliphs
                                                    represent a foundational phase in developing the concept of ‘bidʿa’.
                                                    The Prophet’s teachings provide a clear guideline against unfounded
                                                    religious innovations, yet his actions also display a certain
                                                    flexibility within the divine framework. The caliphal period,
                                                    particularly under ʾUmar ibn Al-Khattab, illustrates a practical
                                                    application of ‘bidʿa’, acknowledging the evolving needs of the
                                                    Muslim community.</p>

                                                <p>The initial perceptions and responses to ‘bidʿa’ during the Prophetic
                                                    era and its immediate aftermath lay the groundwork for the complex
                                                    and nuanced understanding of the concept in Islamic jurisprudence.
                                                    It underscores the importance of contextualising religious
                                                    innovations within the broader framework of Islamic teachings and
                                                    the socio-historical realities of the Muslim community. This period
                                                    offers valuable insights into the dynamic interplay between
                                                    tradition and change in the early development of Islamic thought.
                                                </p>

                                                <p>During the Umayyad era, there was a significant transformation in the
                                                    understanding and use of the concept of ‘bidʿa’. Originally, ‘bidʿa’
                                                    was solely a theological concept, but it gradually became a powerful
                                                    political tool. The Islamic jurists of that time had the task of
                                                    redefining the boundaries of ‘bidʿa’ to maintain the unity of the
                                                    Islamic state. As the Umayyad period progressed, the concept of
                                                    ‘bidʿa’ underwent notable changes. It evolved from being primarily a
                                                    theological concept to becoming a political legitimisation and
                                                    control tool. The caliphs and their supporters were clever in using
                                                    the label of ‘bidʿa’ to discredit and suppress oppositional
                                                    religious practices, thus consolidating their rule (Hodgson, M. “The
                                                    Venture of Islam”, 1974). In response to this political
                                                    manipulation, influential jurists such as Imam Malik and Al-Awza’i
                                                    played a crucial role in redefining the concept of ‘bidʿa’ more
                                                    nuancedly. They aimed to balance preserving religious traditions and
                                                    addressing the practicalities of governing a vast and diverse
                                                    Islamic state (Melchert, C. “The Formation of the Sunni Schools of
                                                    Law”, 1997). Their goal was to ensure the stability and coherence of
                                                    the Islamic society by carefully reconsidering the scope and
                                                    implications of ‘bidʿa’.</p>

                                                <p>By expanding the understanding and usage of ‘bidʿa’, the Umayyad era
                                                    witnessed a theological and political transformation and a complex
                                                    interplay between religious authority and political power. The
                                                    evolving concept of ‘bidʿa’ served as a tool for the caliphs to
                                                    assert their authority and suppress dissent. At the same time, the
                                                    jurists worked diligently to redefine the boundaries of ‘bidʿa’ in a
                                                    way that would safeguard the integrity of the Islamic State and its
                                                    diverse community.</p>

                                                <p>During the Abbasid Period, there was a significant diversification in
                                                    Islamic thought. The promotion of intellectual pursuits by the
                                                    Abbasids led to the emergence of various theological and
                                                    philosophical schools of thought. This period was marked by a
                                                    dynamic and lively discussion surrounding the concept of ‘bidʿa’.
                                                    Scholars debated defining the boundaries and exploring the
                                                    implications of ‘bidʿa’ (Makdisi, G. “The Rise of Colleges:
                                                    Institutions of Learning in Islam and the West”, 1981).</p>

                                                <p>One of the notable developments during this period was the emergence
                                                    of rationalist approaches to ‘bidʿa’. Schools like the Mu’tazila
                                                    brought new perspectives and ideas to the concept, often challenging
                                                    the traditionalists. This resulted in debates and disagreements
                                                    regarding what should be considered acceptable innovation within
                                                    Islamic practice (Watt, W.M. “Islamic Philosophy and Theology”,
                                                    1985).</p>

                                                <p>Another critical aspect of the Abbasid Period was the rise of Sufism,
                                                    which introduced unique practices and interpretations that were
                                                    sometimes seen as innovative. Sufi leaders, such as Al-Ghazali,
                                                    played a crucial role in navigating the concept of ‘bidʿa’. They
                                                    emphasised the importance of inner spiritual renewal while staying
                                                    within the boundaries of Sharīʿa (Al-Ghazali, “Ihya’ ‘Ulum al-Din”,
                                                    1981).</p>


                                                <p>The Umayyad and Abbasid periods were instrumental in shaping the
                                                    discourse on ‘bidʿa’, reflecting the complexities and dynamism of
                                                    the Islamic world during these times. The concept evolved from a
                                                    tool for political control to a subject of intricate theological
                                                    debate, illustrating the adaptability of Islamic jurisprudence to
                                                    changing contexts. This evolution in the understanding of ‘bidʿa’
                                                    reveals the intellectual and spiritual growth of the Muslim
                                                    community over time.</p>

                                                <p>The Abbasid era, in particular, marked a flourishing of intellectual
                                                    thought that greatly influenced Islamic legal and theological
                                                    frameworks. The diverse approaches to ‘bidʿa’, from the rationalist
                                                    arguments of the Mu’tazila to the spiritual interpretations of Sufi
                                                    scholars, highlight the multifaceted nature of Islamic
                                                    jurisprudence. These different perspectives fostered a rich tapestry

                                                    development of the concept of ‘bidʿa’ during the Umayyad and Abbasid
                                                    eras underscores the dynamic interplay between religious doctrine,
                                                    political power, and intellectual thought in Islamic history. This
                                                    period laid the groundwork for subsequent Islamic legal and
                                                    theological developments, reflecting the enduring nature of the
                                                    discourse on religious innovation within the Muslim tradition. The
                                                    study of ‘bidʿa’ during this period provides valuable insights into
                                                    the evolution of Islamic thought and the complexities of its

                                                    on ‘bidʿa’ could provide a deeper understanding of the concept’s
                                                    complexities. For example, studying the works of prominent jurists
                                                    like Imam Malik and Al-Awza’i or delving into the teachings of Sufi
                                                    scholars like Al-Ghazali can shed light on the diverse
                                                    interpretations and applications of ‘bidʿa’ during this time.</p>

                                                <p>Additionally, examining the social and cultural context of the

                                                    factors that shaped the understanding and perception of ‘bidʿa’.
                                                    Analysing historical events, intellectual movements, and the broader
                                                    socio-political landscape can provide a comprehensive picture of how
                                                    the concept of ‘bidʿa’ evolved and influenced Islamic thought.</p>

                                                <p>The period of the Umayyad and Abbasid caliphates witnessed
                                                    significant developments in the understanding and application of the
                                                    concept of ‘bidʿa’. From being primarily a theological concept to
                                                    becoming a tool of political control, ‘bidʿa’ underwent notable
                                                    transformations during this time. The Umayyad era saw the
                                                    redefinition of ‘bidʿa’ boundaries to maintain the unity of the
                                                    Islamic state. In contrast, the Abbasid era witnessed a
                                                    diversification of thought and the emergence of various perspectives
                                                    on ‘bidʿa’. These periods offer a wealth of material for further
                                                    research and provide valuable insights into the evolution of Islamic
                                                    thought and the complexities of the concept of ‘bidʿa’.</p>

                                                <p>The concept of ‘bidʿa Ḥasana’ (commendable innovation) and ‘bidʿa
                                                    sayi’a’ (reprehensible innovation). In Islamic jurisprudence,
                                                    innovations refer to practices or beliefs introduced into the
                                                    religion that were not present during the time of the Prophet
                                                    Muhammad. The general ruling among many scholars is that such
                                                    innovations are undesirable, as they deviate from the original
                                                    teachings of Islam. Despite the general aversion to innovation, some
                                                    scholars differentiate between ‘good’ (bidʿa Ḥasana) and ‘bad’
                                                    (bidʿa say’ia) innovations. This categorisation often relies on
                                                    historical precedents and the practices’ perceived benefits or
                                                    harms. To understand this phenomenon, we should explore ʾUmar’s
                                                    Endorsement of Tarāwīh, a frequently cited example in this
                                                    discourse. The Caliph ʾUmar’s remark regarding the Tarāwīh prayer
                                                    during Ramaḍān, “How good this innovation is?” This statement is
                                                    often interpreted as an acknowledgement that specific innovations if
                                                    aligned with the spirit of Islamic teachings, can be beneficial
                                                    (Al-Ṭabarī, Muhammad ibn Jarir. “Tarikh al-Ṭabarī”). Scholars
                                                    dissecting this statement argue that ʾUmar’s endorsement was not of
                                                    innovation in a general sense but instead of a practice that had
                                                    roots in the Prophet’s teachings but was not institutionalised until
                                                    his time.</p>

                                                <p>Opponents of categorising innovations often refer to Quranic verses
                                                    that emphasise adherence to the revelations and the teachings of the
                                                    Prophet. They argue that categorising innovations as ‘good’ or ‘bad’
                                                    introduces subjectivity into religious practices, potentially

                                                    that the mere prevalence of practice does not equate to a consensus

                                                <p>The debate over innovation in Islamic jurisprudence reflects a
                                                    complex interplay between adherence to traditional Islamic teachings
                                                    and the evolving practices of the Muslim community. While some
                                                    scholars advocate for a flexible approach that allows for the
                                                    categorisation of innovations, others adhere to a more rigid
                                                    interpretation that views any deviation from the established
                                                    practices of the Prophet’s time as undesirable. This discourse
                                                    underscores the ongoing challenge within Islamic scholarship of
                                                    balancing the preservation of religious integrity with the realities
                                                    of a diverse and evolving Muslim community.</p>

                                                <p>The critical question is whether a practice considered ‘good’ and
                                                    innovative is genuinely an innovation or an extension of the Sunna
                                                    not explicitly practised during the Prophet’s time. This
                                                    differentiation is crucial in understanding whether such practices
                                                    contradict the fundamental principle that “each innovation is an
                                                    error,” as stated in various Ḥadīths. The Criterion of Goodness: For
                                                    an innovation to be categorised as ‘good’, it must be substantiated
                                                    with evidence of its alignment with Islamic principles. We will
                                                    examine whether practices often labelled as ‘good’ innovations, like
                                                    the Tarāwīh prayer, meet the criteria set by Sharīʿa.</p>

                                                <p>The Tarāwīh prayer, while not a compulsory part of the Islamic
                                                    ritual, was practised by the Prophet Muhammad. However, its
                                                    institutionalisation in a congregational form by Caliph ʾUmar raises
                                                    questions about its classification as an innovation. ʾUmar’s
                                                    Justification: Investigating ʾUmar’s rationale behind organising the
                                                    Tarāwīh prayer in a congregational format and the subsequent
                                                    labelling of this act as a ‘good innovation’ provides insights into
                                                    the understanding and application of ‘bidʿa’ in early Islamic
                                                    history.</p>

                                                <p>The discussion on ‘bidʿa’ in Islamic jurisprudence, especially
                                                    concerning practices like the Tarāwīh prayer, reflects the nuanced
                                                    approach required in classifying and understanding innovations. The
                                                    analysis underscores the need for a careful and contextual
                                                    interpretation of innovations in Islamic law, considering both
                                                    historical practices and contemporary applications.</p>

                                                <p>One prominent example is the compilation of the Quran into a single
                                                    text after the Prophet Muhammad’s death. During the Prophet’s life,
                                                    the Quranic revelation was ongoing, and the text remained uncompiled
                                                    to accommodate potential amendments. Posthumously, the cessation of
                                                    revelation necessitated the compilation of the Quran. Though
                                                    technically an innovation in its literal sense, this act aligns with
                                                    the Sunna and hence is not considered ‘bidʿa’ in Sharīʿa terms.</p>

                                                <p>Another example is the directive given by the Prophet Muhammad to
                                                    ʾUmar regarding the expulsion of Jews from Khaybr and Christians
                                                    from Najran, which was implemented after the Prophet’s death. While
                                                    ʾUmar’s actions occurred posthumously, they were in direct
                                                    accordance with the Prophet’s instructions, thus exempting them from
                                                    being labelled innovations in a Sharīʿa context. Abu Bakr’s War on
                                                    Zakat Defaulters: Another instance is Abu Bakr’s decision to wage
                                                    war against those who refused to pay Zakat after the Prophet’s
                                                    passing. Despite its posthumous nature, this decision was based on
                                                    the established Islamic principle of Zakat, upholding the spirit of
                                                    the Prophet’s teachings.</p>

                                                <p>The principle guiding the classification of actions as innovations
                                                    hinges on their utility and alignment with Islamic teachings.
                                                    Actions deemed valid and not contradicting the Prophet’s teachings
                                                    are generally not classified as innovations. If a situation arises
                                                    posthumously that necessitates specific actions that do not oppose
                                                    any explicit prohibition by the Prophet, they may be adopted without
                                                    being considered innovations. Actions in Line with Islamic
                                                    Principles: Actions that the Prophet did not practise due to certain
                                                    hindrances, which were later resolved, can be considered for
                                                    adoption if they align with the overall principles of Islam.</p>


                                                <p>Islamic jurisprudents often diverge into two main viewpoints
                                                    regarding the permissibility of actions. One group believes that
                                                    what is not explicitly prohibited is permissible. The other contends
                                                    that only actions explicitly commanded or exemplified by the Prophet
                                                    are permissible. The latter viewpoint further divides into two
                                                    schools of thought: those who adhere strictly to the Prophet’s
                                                    words, deeds, or affirmations (rejecting the principle of analogy)
                                                    and those who accept commands based on the Prophet’s teachings or
                                                    their implications, thus recognising the principle of analogy.</p>

                                                <p>The Prophet Muhammad expressed concerns about potential errors
                                                    scholars commit in interpreting religious texts and the impact of
                                                    misguided leaders. This statement, recorded by several Companions,
                                                    underscores the importance of vigilance in religious interpretation
                                                    and leadership. Implications for Contemporary Islamic Thought: This
                                                    warning is particularly relevant in contemporary discussions where
                                                    the role of Ulama and Sufis is scrutinised, especially regarding
                                                    their interpretations and innovations in Islamic practices.</p>

                                                <p>A notable example of an alleged innovation is the introduction of the
                                                    Adhan for Eid prayers. Historically, this practice was not observed
                                                    during the Prophet’s time but was later introduced by a ruler and
                                                    subsequently contested by the Muslim community. Analysing the
                                                    Rationale and Opposition: Despite being seemingly strong and rooted
                                                    in Islamic principles of remembrance of Allah, the argument for
                                                    Adhan in Eid prayers is classified as an innovation due to its
                                                    absence in the Prophet’s practice. The Prophet’s consistent omission
                                                    of Adhan in Eid prayers is interpreted as an intentional Sunna,
                                                    thereby rendering any alteration in this practice an innovation.</p>

                                                <p>If a need for a specific action existed during the Prophet’s time,
                                                    and he chose not to act on it, it is considered that he did not
                                                    recognise its necessity. Such an omission is viewed as a Sunna,
                                                    guiding Muslims against adopting practices not endorsed by the
                                                    Prophet. Implications for Religious Innovations: This principle
                                                    challenges the legitimacy of religious innovations introduced based
                                                    on perceived virtues or needs not acknowledged or practised by the
                                                    Prophet. It questions the validity of practices like delivering
                                                    sermons before Eid prayers, which were introduced for reasons
                                                    different from the Prophet’s intentions.</p>

                                                <p>Discerning permissible acts and innovations requires a nuanced
                                                    understanding of the Prophet’s teachings and practices in Islamic
                                                    jurisprudence. The analysis highlights the importance of adhering to
                                                    the Sunna in determining the permissibility of religious practices
                                                    and cautions against innovations introduced by religious leaders or
                                                    scholars that deviate from the Prophet’s example. This study
                                                    contributes to the broader discourse on the role of Ulama and Sufis
                                                    in shaping Islamic practices, emphasising the need for careful and
                                                    authentic interpretation of Islamic teachings.</p>

                                                <p>The Prophet Muhammad is quoted as saying, “When people introduce an
                                                    innovation, Allah withdraws from them Sunna in an equal measure”
                                                    (Iqtidā’ aṣ-Ṣirāṭ al-Mustaqīm li-Mukhālafat Aṣḥāb al-Jahīm).</p>

                                                <p>This statement underscores the potential spiritual risks associated
                                                    with innovations, suggesting that introducing non-sanctioned
                                                    practices could diminish established Sunna. Implications for
                                                    Spiritual Practice: The analogy that if one’s heart is filled with
                                                    innovation, there leaves no room for Sunna can be likened to
                                                    consuming unhealthy food, which diminishes the appetite for
                                                    nutritious sustenance. This metaphor illustrates that unwarranted
                                                    innovations could overshadow or replace authentic religious
                                                    practices.</p>

                                                <p>Historical examples indicate that rulers have introduced various
                                                    practices, such as unjust taxes and punishments, out of a deviation
                                                    from the principles of justice and equality as emphasised in Islam.
                                                    These innovations are critiqued for not aligning with the model of
                                                    the Rightly Guided Caliphs and just rulers like ʾUmar bin Abd
                                                    Al-Aziz. The failure of some Ulama to adhere strictly to the Quranic
                                                    teachings is highlighted. The Quran states,</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">قَدْ نَرَىٰ تَقَلُّبَ وَجْهِكَ فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ ۖ فَلَنُوَلِّيَنَّكَ
                                                    قِبْلَةًۭ تَرْضَىٰهَا ۚ فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ
                                                    ٱلْحَرَامِ ۚ وَحَيْثُ مَا كُنتُمْ فَوَلُّوا۟ وُجُوهَكُمْ شَطْرَهُۥ ۗ
                                                    وَإِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ لَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهُ
                                                    ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ ۗ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَـٰفِلٍ عَمَّا
                                                    يَعْمَلُونَ ١٤٤</p>

                                                <p>“Thus We have made you a just nation, that you be witnesses over
                                                    mankind” (Q. 2:144).</p>

                                                <p>Which emphasises the ideal of being a balanced and just community.
                                                    Deviations from this ideal by the Ulama have led to
                                                    misinterpretations and unwarranted innovations. For the best
                                                    understanding of bidʿa, we should explore some famous examples.
                                                    Perhaps the most well-known innovation is the Mawlid, celebrating
                                                    the Prophet Muhammad’s birth, occupying a unique and sometimes
                                                    contested position in Islamic tradition. While not established
                                                    during the Prophet’s lifetime, it has become a significant cultural
                                                    and religious event in many Muslim communities worldwide.</p>

                                                <p>Furthermore, it is essential to note that Mawlid celebrations have
                                                    gained religious significance and serve as a platform for fostering
                                                    community cohesion and reinforcing cultural identity. Through
                                                    commemorating the Prophet Muhammad’s birth, Muslim communities come
                                                    together to express their love and admiration for the Prophet,
                                                    reinforcing their shared values and beliefs. This communal aspect of
                                                    Mawlid celebrations is crucial in promoting unity and solidarity
                                                    among Muslims worldwide.</p>

                                                <p>Before delving into the Islamic tradition of Mawlid, it is crucial to
                                                    understand the cultural and religious landscape of pre-Islamic
                                                    Arabia, often referred to as Jahiliyyah (the Age of Ignorance). This
                                                    era was characterised by tribal affiliations and polytheistic
                                                    beliefs, where numerous deities were worshipped in various regions.
                                                    Commemorative practices were often tied to tribal histories and
                                                    significant events rather than celebrating individual life events
                                                    like birthdays. The prevalent social customs were deeply rooted in
                                                    honour, oral poetry, and complex tribal laws (Hoyland, Robert G.

                                                <p>By exploring the historical and cultural context of pre-Islamic
                                                    Arabia, we can better grasp the transformative nature of the
                                                    emergence of Islam and the subsequent establishment of Mawlid
                                                    celebrations. Understanding the cultural backdrop against which
                                                    Mawlid developed allows us to appreciate the significance and impact
                                                    of this religious observance within the broader Islamic tradition.
                                                    Through a comprehensive analysis of Mawlid’s evolution, this paper
                                                    seeks to shed light on the multifaceted aspects of this celebration
                                                    and its enduring importance in contemporary Muslim societies.</p>

                                                <p>The arrival of Islam brought about a significant change in cultural
                                                    practices. The Islamic belief system, focused on monotheism and the
                                                    teachings of Prophet Muhammad, gradually replaced the polytheistic
                                                    and tribal customs of Jahiliyyah. The Quran and Ḥadīth, the primary
                                                    sources of Islamic teachings, do not explicitly mention the
                                                    celebration of birthdays or similar personal commemorations.
                                                    Instead, the emphasis was placed on commemorating religious events
                                                    such as the revelation of the Quran and significant battles. This
                                                    early Islamic perspective shifted the focus from individual
                                                    glorification to collective religious observance (Nasr, Seyyed

                                                <p>The celebration of the birth of Prophet Muhammad, known as Mawlid,
                                                    was first recorded several centuries after his passing. This
                                                    celebration, which has become an essential part of Islamic
                                                    tradition, is believed to have originated in Egypt during the 10th
                                                    and 11th centuries under the Fatimid Dynasty, known for their Shia
                                                    Islamic caliphate. The Fatimids held grand celebrations for various
                                                    events, including the birthdays of significant figures in Shia Islam
                                                    (Halm, Heinz. “The Fatimids and their Traditions of Learning.” I.B.
                                                    Tauris, 1997).</p>

                                                <p>As the tradition of celebrating Mawlid spread, it took on different
                                                    forms and expressions across the Islamic world. Local customs,
                                                    theological interpretations, and the political climate of various
                                                    regions influenced this diversification. In some areas, Mawlid
                                                    became a platform for reciting poetry praising the Prophet and
                                                    delivering sermons highlighting his life and teachings.
                                                    Additionally, it became an occasion for communal feasting and
                                                    community gatherings.</p>

                                                <p>During its early stages, the acceptance of Mawlid celebrations was
                                                    common. The practice varied greatly and was often influenced by the
                                                    ruling authority’s stance on religious ceremonies and gatherings.
                                                    However, over time, Mawlid became more widely accepted and embraced
                                                    by different communities, contributing to its continued popularity
                                                    and significance in Islamic culture.</p>

                                                <p>From its inception, the practice of Mawlid has sparked various
                                                    scholarly interpretations and debates within the Islamic community.
                                                    This diversity of opinions has led to a rich and complex discussion
                                                    surrounding the celebration of the Prophet’s birth.</p>

                                                <p>On the one hand, some scholars view the celebration of Mawlid as a
                                                    positive innovation (‘bidʿa Ḥasana’). They argue that commemorating
                                                    the Prophet’s birth expresses love, reverence, and gratitude towards
                                                    him. In their view, the Prophet’s emphasis on remembering and
                                                    revering key religious events provides a foundation for legitimising
                                                    the celebration of Mawlid (Al-Suyuti, Jalal ad-Din. “al-Hawi
                                                    lil-Fatawi”).</p>

                                                <p>On the other hand, some scholars oppose the celebration, categorising
                                                    it as an unnecessary innovation (‘bidʿa’) not practised by the
                                                    Prophet or his immediate followers (Salaf). According to them, every
                                                    religious practice should have a direct basis in the Quran and
                                                    Ḥadīth. Since Mawlid lacks such a basis, it should not be observed
                                                    (Ibn Taymiyya, Taqi ad-Din Ahmad. “Majmu’ al-Fatawa”).</p>

                                                <p>These differing perspectives contribute to a nuanced and ongoing
                                                    discourse surrounding the celebration of Mawlid. While some
                                                    emphasise the importance of expressing love and reverence for the
                                                    Prophet through this practice, others prioritise adherence to
                                                    established religious traditions. As a result, the debate continues
                                                    to evolve, with scholars engaging in rigorous analysis and
                                                    interpretation of historical texts and teachings.</p>

                                                <p>The practice of celebrating the Mawlid, also known as the birth of
                                                    the Prophet Muhammad, began to emerge several centuries after his
                                                    passing. Interestingly, the earliest recorded Mawlid celebrations
                                                    can be traced back to the Fatimid Dynasty in 10th and 11th century
                                                    Egypt. The Fatimids, who followed the Shia branch of Islam, were
                                                    renowned for their extravagant and elaborate public commemorations
                                                    of religious events. These included the birthdays of Ahl al-Bayt and
                                                    other significant figures in Islamic history. A comprehensive
                                                    research conducted by Farhad Daftary in his book “The Isma’ilis:
                                                    Their History and Doctrines,” published by Cambridge University
                                                    Press in 1990, provides valuable insights into the Fatimid practices
                                                    and traditions. This rich tradition of celebrating the Mawlid was
                                                    integral to the Fatimid’s approach to institutionalising religious
                                                    festivals. It is worth noting that this practice was relatively less
                                                    common in Sunni traditions during the same period.</p>

                                                <p>As the tradition of Mawlid spread beyond the Fatimid Caliphate, it
                                                    gradually entered various Sunni communities, particularly in the
                                                    12th century and later. Local customs, theological leanings, and
                                                    socio-political factors prevalent in different regions of the
                                                    Islamic world influenced the adoption of Mawlid.</p>

                                                <p>1. Cultural Integration: In regions like Persia and later in the
                                                    Indian subcontinent, Mawlid festivities incorporated local cultural
                                                    elements such as poetry recitals, Sufi gatherings, and public
                                                    sermons. This integration with regional traditions played a
                                                    significant role in popularising the celebration of Mawlid across
                                                    diverse Muslim communities (Schimmel, Annemarie. “And Muhammad is
                                                    His Messenger: The Veneration of the Prophet in Islamic Piety.”
                                                    University of North Carolina Press, 1985).</p>

                                                <p>2. Role of Sufi Orders: Sufi orders, focusing on the love and
                                                    veneration of the Prophet Muhammad, played a crucial role in the
                                                    spread of Mawlid celebrations. Sufi sheikhs and poets like
                                                    Jalaluddin Rumi contributed to the development of a rich body of
                                                    literature that celebrated the Prophet’s life and virtues, which was
                                                    often recited during Mawlid gatherings (Rumi, Jalaluddin. “The
                                                    Essential Rumi.” Translated by Coleman Barks, HarperOne, 2004).</p>

                                                <p>3. Political Patronage: In some cases, Mawlid celebrations received
                                                    support from ruling elites, who saw them as opportunities to display
                                                    their piety and strengthen their religious legitimacy. This was
                                                    particularly evident during the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt and the
                                                    Ottoman Empire, where Mawlid was celebrated with grandeur and
                                                    ceremony (Ayalon, David. “The Mamluks in Egyptian and Syrian
                                                    Politics and Society.” Brill, 2004).</p>

                                                <p>The observance of Mawlid, the celebration of the Prophet Muhammad’s
                                                    birthday, varied significantly across different Islamic communities.
                                                    This variation can be seen in three key aspects: the nature of the
                                                    festivities, the rituals practised, and the theological debates
                                                    surrounding the observance.</p>

                                                <p>1. Public vs Private Celebrations: Mawlid was a public event with
                                                    large gatherings and elaborate festivities in some regions. These
                                                    celebrations would often include processions, parades, and public
                                                    speeches. On the other hand, in specific communities, Mawlid was
                                                    observed more quietly within homes or local communities. Here, the
                                                    focus was on intimate gatherings, where individuals would come
                                                    together to recite the Prophet’s biography, offer prayers, and
                                                    engage in acts of charity.</p>

                                                <p>2. Ritual Practices: The rituals associated with Mawlid celebrations
                                                    varied greatly. They ranged from recitations of the Prophet’s
                                                    biography and Qur’anic recitations to communal feasts and charity.
                                                    Some communities would organise special lectures or sermons on the
                                                    life and teachings of the Prophet, while others would engage in
                                                    collective prayers and hymns. The specific practices observed during
                                                    Mawlid depended on the cultural and religious traditions of the
                                                    community in question.</p>

                                                <p>3. Theological Debates: The spread of Mawlid celebrations was not
                                                    without controversy. Some Islamic scholars argued that Mawlid, an
                                                    innovation not practised by the Prophet or his companions, should
                                                    not be part of Islamic tradition. They believed that adhering
                                                    strictly to the Qur’an and Sunna, the teachings and practices of the
                                                    Prophet, was the only way to ensure the authenticity of religious
                                                    observance. This debate was particularly pronounced among scholars
                                                    emphasising a conservative interpretation of Islamic teachings.</p>

                                                <p>In their arguments against the observance of Mawlid, these scholars
                                                    highlighted the importance of avoiding any practices that the
                                                    Prophet or his companions did not directly prescribe. They believed
                                                    that introducing new rituals or celebrations could lead to the
                                                    dilution of Islamic identity and the blurring of the lines between
                                                    Islamic and non-Islamic religious practices.</p>
                                                <p>However, it is essential to note that the debate surrounding Mawlid
                                                    is only sometimes agreed upon within the Islamic community. While
                                                    some scholars reject its observance, others argue it is a legitimate
                                                    expression of love and respect for the Prophet Muhammad. They
                                                    believe that as long as the celebrations are conducted in a manner
                                                    that does not contradict Islamic teachings, they can foster
                                                    spiritual connection and unity among Muslims.</p>

                                                <p>The observance of Mawlid varied greatly across different Islamic
                                                    communities. It was marked by differences like the celebrations, the
                                                    rituals practised, and the theological debates surrounding its
                                                    legitimacy. The ongoing discourse surrounding Mawlid reflects the
                                                    diverse perspectives within the Islamic community and the continuing
                                                    endeavour to strike a balance between religious tradition and
                                                    cultural expressions of faith.</p>

                                                <p>The celebration of Mawlid, which marks the birth of the Prophet
                                                    Muhammad, has been a subject of extensive discussions and debates
                                                    among Islamic scholars throughout history. While the Quran and
                                                    Ḥadīth do not explicitly mention Mawlid, classical scholars have
                                                    approached this topic by considering the broader principles of
                                                    Islamic jurisprudence and the concept of bidʿa.</p>

                                                <p>Endorsement by Some Scholars: Among the classical scholars who
                                                    support Mawlid celebrations, Jalal ad-Din al-Suyuti stands out as a
                                                    prominent figure. Al-Suyuti, a respected jurist and theologian from
                                                    15th-century Egypt argued that Mawlid was a commendable event that
                                                    allowed Muslims to express joy and gratitude for the birth of the
                                                    Prophet Muhammad. In his renowned work “al-Hawi lil-Fatawi,”
                                                    al-Suyuti provided a solid foundation for celebrating Mawlid within
                                                    the framework of Islamic law. He asserted that since the celebration
                                                    of Mawlid does not contradict the teachings of Sharīʿa and promotes
                                                    a closer adherence to the Prophet’s instructions, it should be
                                                    regarded as a positive innovation (bidʿa Ḥasana) (al-Suyuti, Jalal
                                                    ad-Din. “al-Hawi lil-Fatawi”).</p>

                                                <p>Opposition by Other Scholars: On the other hand, there are scholars
                                                    like Ibn Taymiyya, a prominent theologian from the 14th century and
                                                    a leading figure in the Hanbali school of jurisprudence, who opposed
                                                    the practice of Mawlid. Ibn Taymiyya, while acknowledging the
                                                    importance of love and reverence for the Prophet, argued that adding
                                                    events like Mawlid to religious practices was unnecessary and could
                                                    potentially lead to reprehensible innovation (bid’ah say’iah). He
                                                    emphasised the significance of adhering strictly to the religious
                                                    practices established during the time of the Prophet and his
                                                    companions (Ibn Taymiyya, Taqi ad-Din Ahmad. “Majmu’ al-Fatāwā”).

                                                <p>The debate surrounding Mawlid, the celebration of the Prophet
                                                    Muhammad’s birthday, has been a topic of discussion among Islamic
                                                    scholars and jurists throughout history. Their opinions on Mawlid
                                                    vary, influenced by different jurisprudential methodologies and
                                                    interpretations of Islamic tradition.</p>

                                                <p>Within the diverse landscape of Islamic jurisprudence, different
                                                    madhhabs (schools) have expressed varying opinions on Mawlid. Some
                                                    scholars from the Maliki and Shāfiʻī schools have found space to
                                                    accommodate its celebration within their jurisprudential frameworks.
                                                    They argue that Mawlid allows one to express love and devotion to
                                                    the Prophet Muhammad and reflect on his exemplary life and
                                                    teachings. On the other hand, scholars from the Hanafi and Hanbali
                                                    schools have taken a more cautious approach, emphasising the
                                                    avoidance of innovations in religious practices and highlighting the
                                                    importance of adhering strictly to the Quran and Sunna. Sufi
                                                    Scholars’ Perspectives: Sufi scholars who emphasise the spiritual
                                                    aspect of Islam have generally been proponents of Mawlid. They view
                                                    it as an occasion to deepen their connection with the Prophet
                                                    Muhammad and express their love and devotion to him. In various Sufi
                                                    traditions, Mawlid has been celebrated with recitations of poetry,
                                                    songs, and stories about the Prophet’s life, aiming to inspire
                                                    spiritual growth and foster a sense of unity among the believers.
                                                    These scholars argue that Mawlid serves as a reminder of the
                                                    Prophet’s teachings and his role as a mercy to humanity, encouraging
                                                    followers to emulate his noble qualities daily.</p>

                                                <p>The debate over Mawlid continues in modern times, reflecting broader
                                                    discussions about religious practice, innovation, and tradition in
                                                    Islam. Scholars and intellectuals have offered different
                                                    perspectives, advocating for various approaches. Some contemporary
                                                    scholars advocate for a more flexible interpretation of Islamic
                                                    tradition. They suggest that practices like Mawlid can enhance
                                                    religious experience and community cohesion, provided they do not
                                                    contradict fundamental Islamic principles. These scholars argue that
                                                    Islam is a dynamic and living faith that can adapt to the changing
                                                    needs of its followers. They highlight the importance of considering
                                                    the spiritual and social benefits of Mawlid celebrations, such as
                                                    fostering a sense of unity and strengthening the bond among Muslims.
                                                    However, they also emphasise the need for caution and ensuring that
                                                    such celebrations do not deviate from the core teachings of Islam.
                                                </p>

                                                <p>Conversely, conservative scholars often maintain that Mawlid is an
                                                    unnecessary innovation. They stress the importance of strictly
                                                    following the Quran and Sunna as the primary sources of guidance in
                                                    Islamic practice. These scholars argue that the Prophet Muhammad and
                                                    his companions did not celebrate Mawlid during their time, and
                                                    therefore, introducing such celebrations would be a departure from
                                                    the established practices of the early Muslim community. They
                                                    caution against any practices that are not firmly rooted in the
                                                    teachings of the Prophet and urge Muslims to focus on the core
                                                    rituals and principles of Islam.</p>

                                                <p>As the debate over Mawlid continues, it reflects the ongoing
                                                    endeavour to balance preserving the integrity of Islamic traditions
                                                    and accommodating Muslim communities’ evolving needs and
                                                    aspirations. It also highlights the broader discussions about
                                                    religious practice, innovation, and tradition in Islam as Muslims
                                                    navigate the complexities of the modern world while remaining
                                                    faithful to their religious commitments.</p>

                                                <p>The scholarly perspectives on Mawlid reflect a broader dialogue
                                                    within Islamic jurisprudence regarding religious innovation,
                                                    tradition, and how Muslims express their devotion and connection to
                                                    the Prophet Muhammad. The diversity of opinions on Mawlid highlights
                                                    the rich tapestry of Islamic scholarly thought and the ongoing
                                                    discourse within the Muslim world.</p>

                                                <p>The celebration of Mawlid found a significant advocate in the Ottoman
                                                    Empire, where it was embraced and institutionalised with royal
                                                    support. The Ottomans, who ruled from the 14th to the early 20th
                                                    century, were crucial in promoting and formalising Mawlid
                                                    celebrations. Under their reign, Mawlid evolved from a primarily
                                                    local and spiritual observance into a grandiose, state-sponsored
                                                    event.</p>

                                                <p>The Ottomans incorporated Mawlid into their religious and political
                                                    calendar, establishing it as an annual event marked by elaborate
                                                    festivities. Sultan Selim II (1566–1574) is often credited with
                                                    initiating the tradition of state-sponsored Mawlid celebrations.
                                                    These events included recitations of the Prophet’s biography, Sufi
                                                    dhikr, and the distribution of food to the public (Elias, Jamal J.
                                                    “Aisha’s Cushion: Religious Art, Perception, and Practice in Islam.”
                                                    Harvard University Press, 2012). The Ottomans used Mawlid to
                                                    strengthen their political legitimacy and reinforce the Sultan’s
                                                    role as the protector and patron of Islam. These celebrations also
                                                    served to unify the diverse subjects of the Empire, fostering a
                                                    sense of communal identity centred around shared religious devotion
                                                    (İnalcık, Halil. “The Ottoman Empire: The Classical Age 1300–1600.”
                                                    Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1973).</p>

                                                <p>The celebration of Mawlid in the Ottoman Empire was intricately
                                                    linked with the politics of legitimacy and authority. As the caliph
                                                    and the seasonal head of the Islamic world, the Sultan utilised
                                                    Mawlid to project his image as a pious and devout ruler, underlining
                                                    his role in upholding and propagating Islamic traditions.</p>

                                                <p>1. Royal Processions and Public Celebrations: Mawlid festivities
                                                    often included processions featuring the Sultan and high-ranking
                                                    officials, reinforcing the political hierarchy. The public nature of
                                                    these celebrations was crucial in projecting the image of the
                                                    Ottoman ruler as a benevolent and religiously committed leader
                                                    (Farah, Caesar E. “The Politics of Interventionism in Ottoman
                                                    Lebanon, 1830–1861.” I.B. Tauris, 2000).</p>

                                                <p>2. Integration of Mawlid with Sufi Practices: The Ottoman embrace of
                                                    Sufism shaped the nature of Mawlid celebrations. Sufi orders,
                                                    enjoying patronage from the Ottoman court, infused the celebrations
                                                    with spiritual rituals, poetry, and music, further elevating the
                                                    event’s religious significance (Lewis, Bernard. “The Emergence of
                                                    Modern Turkey.” Oxford University Press, 2001).</p>

                                                <p>The celebration of Mawlid in the Ottoman Empire was a religious
                                                    observance and a significant cultural event reflecting the Empire’s
                                                    diverse artistic and cultural traditions. This period saw the
                                                    development of unique forms of religious art, music, and literature
                                                    centred around Mawlid.</p>

                                                <p>Ottoman poets, artists, and musicians contributed to a rich corpus of
                                                    Mawlid-related works, including illuminated manuscripts of the
                                                    Prophet’s biography, calligraphic works, and religious hymns
                                                    (Necipoğlu, Gülru. “The Age of Sinan: Architectural Culture in the
                                                    Ottoman Empire.” Reaktion Books, 2005). Mawlid in the Ottoman Empire
                                                    illustrated the interplay between religious observance and cultural
                                                    expression, showcasing how religious events could be imbued with
                                                    local artistic and cultural practices, thereby becoming a part of
                                                    the broader cultural fabric (Grabar, Oleg. “The Formation of Islamic
                                                    Art.” Yale University Press, 1987).</p>

                                                <p>The Ottoman Empire’s patronage and celebration of Mawlid played a
                                                    crucial role in the historical evolution of this practice. It
                                                    transformed Mawlid from a local, spiritual observance into a grand
                                                    state-sponsored event, intertwining it with the political and
                                                    cultural life of the Empire. This period in Islamic history
                                                    exemplifies how political powers can profoundly adapt and elevate
                                                    religious observances, influencing their form, significance, and
                                                    practice.</p>
                                                <p style="font-weight: 700;">Festivals</p>

                                                <p>Eid, a festival, is named after a recurring event. This implies that
                                                    it is held at a place often visited by people and during a specific
                                                    period when a particular act is regularly performed. Similarly, any
                                                    gathering that takes place periodically falls into the same
                                                    category. Innovations can be found within all of these categories.
                                                    There are two main types of seasonal festivals:</p>

                                                <p>1. Sanctifying days that hold no religious significance in Sharīʿa is
                                                    a practice our pious ancestors did not observe. There is no basis to
                                                    consider these days as sacred, such as:</p>

                                                <p style="font-weight: 700;">Rajab festivities</p>

                                                <p>The first Thursday and the following Friday night in the month of
                                                    Rajab are celebrated as “Al-Raghaib” by the ordinary people. Islam
                                                    does not recognise the sanctity of this day or night. This practice
                                                    was first reported after the 4th century (H). A fabricated Ḥadīth is
                                                    presented to support this practice, which, according to religious
                                                    scholars, has no authenticity.</p>

                                                <p>It claims the sacredness of this specific day and night, recommending
                                                    fasting during the day and praying at night. Engaging in prayer and
                                                    fasting, especially on this day and night, is an innovation that
                                                    should be strictly prohibited. This particular day and night should
                                                    be treated like any other. One should not engage in any specific
                                                    actions these days to give the impression that they hold special
                                                    significance. Similarly, in the middle of the month of Rajab, a
                                                    particular day is singled out for a specific prayer called “Salat
                                                    Umm Dadu.” However, according to Sharīʿa, this prayer has no
                                                    religious sanction.</p>

                                                <p>2. To commemorate a specific day on which a particular event occurred
                                                    does not imply that the day itself is sanctified, as similar
                                                    circumstances may have also appeared on other days.</p>

                                                <p style="font-weight: 700;">Eid Khum Ghadeer</p>

                                                <p>While returning from his farewell pilgrimage, the Prophet delivered a
                                                    sermon on the 18th of Dhul Hijja at Khum Ghadeer. He urged everyone
                                                    to follow the Qur’an and provided advice regarding his household, as
                                                    reported by Zayd bin Arqam and recorded in the Ḥadīth collection of
                                                    Muslim. However, certain interpolations have been made by misguided
                                                    individuals in this report. They even claim that the Prophet had
                                                    explicitly commanded the appointment of Ali as the Caliph and had
                                                    seated him in a prominent position. The Companions, however,
                                                    conspired and concealed this command of the Prophet. This was an act
                                                    of great injustice and transgression. Such an act was impossible to
                                                    carry out, as it would not have been possible for someone to conceal
                                                    this statement.</p>

                                                <p>Furthermore, considering the excellent conduct and integrity of the
                                                    Companions, it is inconceivable that they would commit such a
                                                    monstrous act. Our concern here is not the issue of Imama. Our
                                                    objection lies in declaring this specific day special, as it lacks
                                                    sanction in Sharīʿa. Our righteous predecessors did not attach any
                                                    significance to this day, nor did the Prophet’s family consider it
                                                    special. Special days are only those designated as such by Sharīʿa.
                                                    Therefore, we should follow the Sharīʿa rather than indulge in
                                                    something new and fantastical. If this particular day is said to
                                                    hold a special place because the Prophet delivered a sermon on that
                                                    day, he did so on many other days. Likewise, he provided advice on
                                                    several occasions. There were days when significant events occurred,
                                                    such as the battles of Badr, Hunain, and Khandaq, the conquest of
                                                    Makkah, the Hijra, and then reaching Madina. However, no particular
                                                    significance is attached to these days. Christians are guilty of
                                                    this practice, as they commemorate days of particular importance in
                                                    the life of the Prophet Jesus. The Jews also follow this practice.
                                                    In Islam, however, Allah has already prescribed certain days for
                                                    religious festivals, and only those designated days hold this
                                                    position. We should not invent new festivals and add them to our
                                                    religion.</p>

                                                <p style="font-weight: 700;">Milad</p>

                                                <p>The same holds for treating the Prophet’s birthday as a sacred day.
                                                    Muslims do so in imitation of the Christians who celebrate Jesus’
                                                    birthday with much pomp and show. They do so out of their love and
                                                    respect for the Prophet. Allah would reward them for their love for
                                                    the Prophet rather than for innovation. Nonetheless, it should not
                                                    be celebrated as a holy day. Firstly, there is a divergence of
                                                    opinion about the exact date of his birth. Moreover, early Muslims
                                                    did not celebrate it as a holy day, although they could have done so
                                                    without obstacles. If it had been a truly good thing, early Muslims
                                                    would have celebrated it, as they loved the Prophet more than we did
                                                    and were more virtuous than we were. However, they did not do so.
                                                </p>

                                                <p>Expressing love for the Prophet should not be done by holding Milad
                                                    functions. The ideal way is to follow him both inwardly and
                                                    outwardly. He should be followed, his directives implemented, his
                                                    Sunna revived, and his Message propagated. Once it is established
                                                    that something is an innovation and one commits it, he would not
                                                    receive any reward but rather earn Allah’s displeasure. Anniversary
                                                    functions may be held in memory of historical events, but they
                                                    cannot be organised in the belief of earning Allah’s reward.</p>

                                                <p>Strive to make the heart, hand, and tongue work in his cause. This
                                                    was the way early Muslims, both Muhājirūn and Anṣār and subsequent
                                                    generations of pious Muslims maintained it.</p>

                                                <p>Although zealous innovation practitioners may receive some reward for
                                                    their sincerity and good intentions, they are not as enthusiastic
                                                    about following Sharīʿa. They resemble someone who decorates their
                                                    copy of the Qur’an with gold and silver but does not recite it or
                                                    does not put its teachings into practice. They are also like someone
                                                    who decorates a mosque but does not pray there. Another likeness is
                                                    someone who lights lamps and spreads carpets in the mosque yet prays
                                                    there infrequently. Decorating a mosque is not sought by Sharīʿa and
                                                    can lead to hypocrisy and arrogance. Such matters distract
                                                    individuals, making them indifferent to religious duties and causing
                                                    other problems. The same point is made in the Ḥadīth: “When a
                                                    community indulges in misdeeds, it takes to decorating mosques”
                                                    (al-Sunan al-wāridah fī al-fitn).</p>

                                                <p>We should not overlook the fact that there are acts that contain both
                                                    evil and good elements. They are considered good because Sharīʿa
                                                    prescribes a part of them, but they are evil because a part of them
                                                    is invented. These acts may be regarded as good if abandoning them
                                                    might lead to forsaking faith, as in hypocrites and transgressors.
                                                    Many modern-day Muslims suffer from this, as they have adopted such
                                                    acts.</p>

                                                <p>The reformer must adhere outwardly and inwardly to the Sunna in these
                                                    cases. They should instruct their disciples to do the same. They
                                                    should recognise and practice virtue while discerning and avoiding
                                                    evil. Next, they should invite people to the Sunna as much as
                                                    possible. If they observe someone engaging in an undesirable act and
                                                    stopping them from it would cause them to engage in something worse
                                                    or abandon an obligatory act, they should not ask them to give up
                                                    that undesirable practice. If there is some goodness in their
                                                    practice of innovation, try to change it using the goodness
                                                    sanctioned by Sharīʿa. Humans are instinctively drawn to adopt
                                                    something and give up another when offered an alternative. It is
                                                    inappropriate for anyone to abandon goodness unless they do
                                                    something better. The practitioners of innovation and those who have
                                                    forsaken the Sunna are equally condemned. There are many critics of
                                                    innovation who themselves do not follow the Sunna, and many of them
                                                    are even worse than those who practice innovation.</p>

                                                <p>Religion is based on the twin principles of enjoining good and
                                                    forbidding evil. Both principles are complementary and can only be
                                                    established with the other. One cannot enjoin good unless they
                                                    forbid evil. One should ask others to worship Allah and, at the same
                                                    time, forbid them from worshipping anyone other than Allah. The
                                                    credal statement of Islam is: “There is no true god but Allah.” Man
                                                    is meant to act, not to abandon. When we ask someone to abandon
                                                    doing something, it is done to ask them to do its alternative. Since
                                                    evil acts close the door to goodness, it is essential to give them
                                                    up so that one is in a better position to do good. Some people may
                                                    expect to receive great rewards for celebrating the Prophet’s
                                                    birthday. They may receive these rewards due to their sincerity,
                                                    love, and regard for the Prophet. As mentioned earlier, Allah may
                                                    accept the deeds of even those who are not true believers.</p>

                                                <p>Imam Ahmad was once told that a particular ruler had spent one
                                                    thousand dinars on the Qur’an. He replied, “Do not stop him, for it
                                                    is the best thing on which he has spent his money” (Iqtidā’ aṣ-Ṣirāṭ
                                                    al-Mustaqīm li-Mukhālafat Aṣḥāb al-Jahīm). This was said despite
                                                    considering decorating the Qur’an as an undesirable act. This remark
                                                    is because although the ruler’s action was not good, it had a hidden
                                                    virtue. If rulers did not spend money on good causes, they would
                                                    likely waste it on evil deeds lacking goodness. It would have been
                                                    much worse if the ruler had spent the same amount of money on
                                                    sports, pleasure, enjoyment, or Greek books instead of decorating
                                                    the Qur’an. A reformer should, therefore, possess insight into
                                                    religious wisdom. When observing deeds, they should assess their
                                                    merits and demerits and strive to gain a good understanding of the
                                                    degrees of good and evil. In cases of conflicting positions, they
                                                    should give preference to the more important over the lesser one.
                                                    This is the essence of the Messenger’s teachings. It is a notable
                                                    characteristic of Islamic scholars that, in situations of
                                                    confrontation, they emphasise the greater good, reject greater evil,
                                                    and act by more weighty arguments.</p>

                                                <p style="font-weight: 700;">There are three degrees for deeds:</p>

                                                <p>1. Good acts that are prescribed by Sharīʿa and are desirable at all
                                                    times.</p>

                                                <p>2. Good acts that contain elements of goodness, either derived from
                                                    Sharīʿa or based on the sincerity and good intention of the doer.
                                                </p>

                                                <p>3. Acts that are utterly devoid of goodness, either leading to the
                                                    abandonment of a good act or being an evil act in itself.</p>

                                                <p>The Ulama of our days need to understand this point well. They should
                                                    pay attention to the principles and prerequisites of faith and not
                                                    waste their energies on peripheral and marginal issues. They should
                                                    avoid emphasising points that are not important in Sharīʿa, such as
                                                    the outward appearance of people or criticising Muslims based on
                                                    their worldview, which only puts Muslims on an unnecessary trial.
                                                </p>

                                                <p>The first degree is related to following the Sunna both outwardly and
                                                    inwardly, verbally and practically. It is obligatory to have
                                                    knowledge of and teach the Sunna in all matters, academically and
                                                    practically. The Sunna should be prescribed and practised, following
                                                    the example of the early Muslims, the Muhājirūn and the Anṣār, and
                                                    their successors.</p>

                                                <p>The second degree is mainly observed in the conduct of later Muslims.
                                                    Most scholars and commoners fall into this category. They are better
                                                    than those who do not perform good deeds or whose misdeeds are evil
                                                    acts like unbelief, falsehood, cheating, and ignorance.</p>

                                                <p>Thus, those who engage in certain rituals of worship, even if part of
                                                    it is undesirable, such as fasting continuously or renouncing
                                                    natural desires like monks, or spending nights in worship without
                                                    any sanction in Sharīʿa, such as the first night of the month of
                                                    Rajab, are better than those who do not have any good deeds to their
                                                    credit. Many of those who object to these new and invented forms of
                                                    worship are themselves neglectful of worshipping Allah and lack good
                                                    knowledge. They are not inclined to do good deeds, yet they oppose
                                                    acts that are not prescribed in Sharīʿa without following the
                                                    Sharīʿa themselves. A Muslim should adopt all that is good and avoid
                                                    all evil. They should enjoin goodness and forbid evil without caring
                                                    about public criticism, whether from the Ulama or the hypocrites.
                                                </p>

                                                <p>The third category includes important days in Sharīʿa, such as the
                                                    tenth of Muharram, the day of ʾArafa, the two days of Eid, and the
                                                    first ten days of Dhul Hijjah. While these days hold particular
                                                    importance, people often indulge in innovations on these days, which
                                                    should be stopped.</p>

                                                <p style="font-style: italic;">Tenth of Muharram</p>

                                                <p>Regarding the innovation on the tenth of Muharram, some people engage
                                                    in practices such as expressing sorrow, holding gatherings, and
                                                    committing acts that are innovations. Neither Allah nor the Prophet
                                                    has asked or allowed such practices. The early Muslims and the
                                                    Prophet’s family did not engage in these acts.</p>

                                                <p>On this day, Allah granted martyrdom to Hussain, the Prophet’s
                                                    grandson and the leader of the youth in Paradise, along with his
                                                    family members. Allah humiliated those who committed this act of
                                                    injustice. While it is a tragic event in Muslim history, it should
                                                    be treated like any other tragedy. However, practitioners of
                                                    innovations have invented various practices, including adding
                                                    reports that slander the Companions who had no involvement in this
                                                    incident.</p>

                                                <p>Fatima, Hussain’s daughter, reports on the authority of her father
                                                    that the Prophet said: “‘We are from Allah and to Him we should
                                                    return.’ If one recites this as many times as he is reminded of a
                                                    suffering, Allah will reward him each time as much as he did when
                                                    the calamity struck him” (Iqtidā’ aṣ-Ṣirāṭ al-Mustaqīm li-Mukhālafat
                                                    Aṣḥāb al-Jahīm).</p>

                                                <p>Commemorating a particular day or days of mourning is not sanctioned
                                                    by Islam; such practices were more common in the days of Jahiliyah.
                                                    By inventing such practices, these people have deprived themselves
                                                    of fasting on this particular day, even though fasting on this day
                                                    is in line with Sharīʿa.</p>

                                                <p>Some people have invented the practices above, while their opponents
                                                    have introduced further new practices. For example, they take baths,
                                                    shake hands, and spend more money on their households on this
                                                    particular day, citing certain Aḥadīth to support their stance.
                                                    However, these Aḥadīth are false and fabricated.</p>

                                                <p style="font-style: italic;">The Month of Rajab</p>

                                                <p>The same holds for the month of Rajab, one of the sacred months. As
                                                    this month approached, the Prophet invoked: “O Lord! Grant us
                                                    blessings in the month of Rajab and Sha’ban and extend them to
                                                    Ramaḍān” (Mishkat al-Masabih 1369). There is no other authentic
                                                    report regarding the superiority of this month. All reports to this
                                                    effect are inauthentic.</p>

                                                <p>A Ḥadīth that is not proven authentic may be used to encourage
                                                    others. However, it should not be circulated once proven to be a
                                                    fabricated report. If one recounts it, they should specify its
                                                    nature, for the Prophet said: “One who reports a Ḥadīth on my
                                                    authority and regards it as inauthentic is one of those who tell
                                                    lies” (Mishkat al-Masabih, 199).</p>

                                                <p style="font-style: italic;">Fifteenth Night of Sha’ban</p>

                                                <p>The same principle can be applied to the fifteenth night of the month
                                                    of Sha’ban. Multiple reports say this night is widely regarded as a
                                                    blessed occasion. Some devout predecessors associate it with
                                                    particular supplications and acts of worship. Nevertheless, there
                                                    are dissenting opinions from prominent scholars of earlier
                                                    generations who question this belief.</p>

                                                <p>However, the majority of scholars, including Imam Ahmad, tend to
                                                    consider it to be a significant night.</p>

                                                <p>It is important to note that fasting specifically on this day is
                                                    discouraged and not endorsed in Sharīʿa. Celebrating it as an
                                                    exceptional day and preparing elaborate meals is seen as an
                                                    innovation. Likewise, congregating in the mosque at night and
                                                    engaging in special prayers are innovations. Sharīʿa does not permit
                                                    the organisation of gatherings on a specific day with fixed times,
                                                    attendance requirements, and prescribed quantities for voluntary
                                                    prayers.</p>

                                                <p style="font-style: italic;">Innovations on Blessed Days</p>

                                                <p>Some individuals tend to engage in acts of innovation on blessed
                                                    days, both in a spatial and seasonal sense. This makes their actions
                                                    even more egregious as they appear to transgress Sharīʿa rules. One
                                                    example is the conduct on the day of ʾArafa. There is unanimous
                                                    agreement among Muslims that this is prohibited. However,
                                                    practitioners of innovation persist in this wrongdoing. They gather
                                                    at the grave of a saint on that specific day and follow the same
                                                    path pilgrims took to reach ʾArafa. Allah does not authorise this
                                                    innovation; it is a manufactured ritual established as a rival to
                                                    Hajj. Furthermore, it promotes the idea of using graves as gathering
                                                    places.</p>

                                                <p>Similarly, it is forbidden to travel to Bait al-Maqdis to stay there,
                                                    as pilgrims do at ʾArafa. This is a clear error. While visiting Bait
                                                    al-Maqdis for prayer and devotional confinement is desirable, it
                                                    should only be done for these purposes. Bait al-Maqdis is one of the
                                                    three mosques for which it is permissible to undertake a journey.
                                                    However, visiting it during the Hajj season is undesirable, as it
                                                    implies setting a specific time for the visit when there is no
                                                    designated time for this purpose.</p>

                                                <p>Moreover, such a practice confuses Bait al-Maqdis with Hajj and
                                                    presents it as a rival to the Ka’aba. Sharīʿa does not endorse this
                                                    un-Islamic act. Many visitors to Bait al-Maqdis even perform the
                                                    same rituals there, such as circumambulation of Sakhara, shaving
                                                    their hair, and performing other specific and exclusive rituals to
                                                    Hajj. Similarly, it is also undesirable to circumambulate the dome
                                                    of Mount Jabal at ʾArafa.</p>

                                                <p style="font-style: italic;">Musical Instruments in Eid</p>

                                                <p>Using musical instruments and wearing silk clothes is considered
                                                    undesirable during Eid. This practice is not permissible on any day
                                                    other than Eid. Both practices are equally criticised for deviating
                                                    from the Sunna and promoting innovation.</p>

                                                <p>Eid should be celebrated in the same manner as earlier Muslims did.
                                                    One should offer prayers, give charity during Eid al-Fitr, and
                                                    sacrifice an animal during Eid al-Adha. However, some individuals
                                                    neglect these acts prescribed by Sharīʿa. They may also fail to
                                                    recite Takbīr or receive sermons that exclude females, even though
                                                    the Prophet used to address both males and females. Some sermons may
                                                    also lack substance. Additionally, some individuals do not follow
                                                    the Sunna by sacrificing animals inside the place of prayer.</p>

                                                <p>Religion involves performing all prescribed acts and preaching the
                                                    same. It also includes abstaining from forbidden actions and
                                                    discouraging others from doing them. Unfortunately, this Sunna has
                                                    been largely abandoned. Females no longer participate in Eid or
                                                    Jumma prayers despite the Prophet’s effort to ensure their presence.
                                                    He even took special measures, such as having Ayesha borrow clothes
                                                    from her sister, to facilitate their participation.</p>

                                                <p style="font-style: italic;">Gatherings at Specified Locations</p>

                                                <p style="font-weight: 700;">There are three types of spatial gatherings:</p>

                                                <p>1. A place that does not have any special status in Sharīʿa.</p>

                                                <p>2. It is a special place, but visiting it for worship is not
                                                    obligatory.</p>

                                                <p>3. It is a place where one should worship, but it should not be taken
                                                    as a gathering place.</p>

                                                <p>These types of gatherings are mentioned in Aḥadīth. For example, in
                                                    one instance, someone vowed to sacrifice an animal at a specific
                                                    place called “Bawana”. The Prophet asked if there were any idols or
                                                    shrines of the polytheists there. When the person replied no, the
                                                    Prophet instructed him to fulfil his vow. Later, we will discuss the
                                                    Prophet’s statement, “Do not make my grave a place of gathering”
                                                    (Sunan Abu Dawud, 2042) and ʾUmar’s statement, “Do not take places
                                                    associated with the Messengers as gathering places.”</p>

                                                <p>The first category includes places that do not hold any significance
                                                    in Sharīʿa. These places are ordinary and should not be treated
                                                    differently. Visiting such places or gathering there for prayer,
                                                    supplication, or remembrance of Allah is a clear error. If such a
                                                    place has connections to polytheism, it is even more harmful to
                                                    visit. This behavior resembles idolatry or serves as a means to it.
                                                    In the past, priests would visit places associated with idols,
                                                    believing that it would bring them closer to God.</p>

                                                <p style="font-style: italic;">Lamps and Vows</p>

                                                <p>Regardless of the intention, whether for prayer, supplications,
                                                    reciting the Qur’an, remembering Allah, or any religious duty, it is
                                                    prohibited to visit a particular place with the expectation of
                                                    receiving a reward. It is even more prohibited to vow to light a
                                                    specific place, believing that it will help fulfil one’s desires.
                                                    Unfortunately, many misguided individuals hold this belief. All
                                                    scholars agree that such offerings are forbidden. This also applies
                                                    to making vows to feed fish in a specific river or giving money to
                                                    the custodians of a particular place. These actions show
                                                    disobedience to Allah. These custodians resemble the priests who
                                                    used to reside in the temples of Lat, Uzza, and Manat. They
                                                    exploited the ordinary people and prevented them from following the
                                                    path of Allah. These custodians resemble the priests to whom the
                                                    Prophet Ibrahim said: “‘What are these idols to which you are
                                                    inclined?’ (Q. 21:52).” They replied: ‘Nay, but we found our fathers
                                                    doing so.’ He said: ‘Do you observe what you have been worshipping,
                                                    you and your ancient fathers? Verily, they are enemies to me, save
                                                    the Lord of the worlds’ (Q. 26:75-77).</p>

                                                <p>Making a vow to give something to the custodians of such places
                                                    amounts to disobedience to Allah. This type of vow is akin to what
                                                    unbelievers and idolaters make. Performing such a vow is prohibited.
                                                    Instead, one should spend that money on charitable works such as
                                                    constructing mosques or donating it to poor devout Muslims. This
                                                    also applies to places believed to contain the graves of Messengers
                                                    or pious individuals or where it is believed that a pious person had
                                                    stayed, even if it is not true. It falls into the second category if
                                                    it is indeed such a place.</p>

                                                <p style="font-style: italic;">Fake Graves of Saints</p>

                                                <p>Numerous places are claimed to contain graves of saints, but many of
                                                    these claims are false. For instance, it is often said that Ubayy
                                                    Ibn Kaab is buried near the eastern gate of Damascus, but this is
                                                    not true. All scholars agree that he is buried in Madina, not
                                                    Damascus. Therefore, the grave near the eastern gate of Damascus is
                                                    not that of the Prophet’s Companion, Ubayy Ibn Kaab. Similarly, it
                                                    is claimed that the Prophet Hud is buried near a wall of the central
                                                    mosque in Damascus, but no authentic report supports this claim.
                                                    Some reports suggest that he died in Yemen, while others believe he
                                                    is buried in Makkah. He had no connection to Syria.</p>

                                                <p>There is a belief that Uwais al-Qarni is buried outside the Western
                                                    gate of Damascus, but this claim is also incorrect. There is no
                                                    evidence that he died in Damascus, and his visit to Syria is not
                                                    documented. He travelled from Yemen to Iraq, and some believe he was
                                                    killed in the Battle of Ṣiffīn, while others report that he died in
                                                    Iran. There are conflicting reports, but none of them place him in
                                                    Syria. Another false grave in Syria is said to be that of the
                                                    Prophet’s wife, Umm Salma. However, she never visited Syria and did
                                                    not travel after the Prophet’s death. She passed away in Madina.</p>

                                                <p style="font-style: italic;">Hussain’s Head</p>

                                                <p>There is a widely spread belief that a shrine in Cairo contains
                                                    Hussain’s head. However, it is essential to note that all scholars
                                                    have dismissed this belief. It is worth mentioning that there is
                                                    another place, Asqalan, that is also mentioned in this context, but
                                                    it is yet another false report. Some individuals claim that
                                                    Hussain’s head was brought from Asqalan to Cairo for burial, but
                                                    historical evidence contradicts this claim. In reality, Hussain’s
                                                    head was taken to Kufa to be presented to Ibn Ziyad, as documented
                                                    by reliable historical accounts.</p>

                                                <p>In addition to these claims, there are also unfounded assertions that
                                                    Hussain’s head was taken to Syria for inspection by Yazid. However,
                                                    it is essential to clarify that these claims are also untrue. The
                                                    Companions mentioned in this event belong to Iraq, not Syria.
                                                    Therefore, there is no historical basis to support the notion that
                                                    Hussain’s head was taken to Syria.</p>

                                                <p>Furthermore, there are several graves associated with renowned
                                                    figures that are claimed to be significant. However, it is necessary
                                                    to emphasise that these reports are untrue; therefore, these places
                                                    do not hold any historical or religious significance. It is worth
                                                    noting that while some individuals may revere these graves out of
                                                    ignorance, even if they were the graves of saints, it does not
                                                    justify the acts of innovation committed at these fake graves.</p>

                                                <p style="font-style: italic;">The Prophet’s Footsteps</p>

                                                <p>In this category, we encounter places claimed to bear the imprint of
                                                    the Prophet’s foot and other relics. One such imprint is found in
                                                    Bait al-Maqdis, mistakenly believed to be the imprint of the
                                                    Prophet’s foot. Some misguided individuals even consider it to be
                                                    the imprint of Allah’s footsteps. In Damascus, a mosque called
                                                    “Masjid Qadam” supposedly houses an imprint believed to be that of
                                                    Prophet Moses’ foot. However, this story is unfounded, as Prophet
                                                    Moses never visited Damascus or its surroundings.</p>

                                                <p style="font-style: italic;">Seeing a Saint in a Dream</p>

                                                <p>Certain places are associated with the Prophets and saints based
                                                    solely on reports of someone seeing a particular Prophet or saint at
                                                    that specific place in a dream. However, in Islam, a place does not
                                                    hold any special significance and should not be considered a place
                                                    of visit or worship. The people of the Book follow these practices,
                                                    and some ignorant Muslims imitate them. Furthermore, in adopting the
                                                    ways of unbelievers, some Muslims have started drawing pictures of
                                                    Messengers and saints. For example, in Damascus, a mosque called
                                                    “Masjid Kaf'” had an impression of a palm attributed to Ali.
                                                    However, Allah destroyed it.</p>

                                                <p>There are many places in different countries, including Hijaz, to
                                                    which such reports are attributed. For instance, a cave is on the
                                                    right side from Badr to Makkah. According to a famous story, this is
                                                    the same cave where the Prophet and Abu Bakr sought shelter during
                                                    their migration from Makkah to Madinah. However, this story is
                                                    entirely false. The cave in question is situated on Mount Thawr near
                                                    Makkah, and all the people of Makkah are familiar with it.</p>

                                                <p style="font-style: italic;">Reverence of Inanimate Objects</p>

                                                <p>One should not revere this or any other place without sanction in
                                                    Sharīʿa. Holding a particular place in esteem is improper, as it
                                                    resembles idolatry. Reverence for physical objects is worse than
                                                    seasonal reverence, as it is closer to idol worship than reverence
                                                    for intangible things. Sharīʿa ensures that anything even remotely
                                                    associated with polytheism is forbidden. Therefore, praying near a
                                                    grave is prohibited, regardless of whether people hold the grave in
                                                    esteem or not. This is done to prevent grave worship.</p>

                                                <p style="font-style: italic;">Places Associated with Innovation and Masjid Dirar</p>

                                                <p>All of these places are similar to Masjid Dirar, which was founded on
                                                    false beliefs. As a consequence, the entire structure was
                                                    demolished. Masjid Dirar was built to cause discord among Muslims
                                                    and support the enemies of Allah and His Messenger. Therefore, Allah
                                                    instructed Prophet Muhammad not to pray there and instead directed
                                                    him to demolish it. These false shrines have also been established
                                                    as rivals to mosques, which are the houses of Allah. This is a
                                                    Satanic scheme to venerate those whom Allah has not commanded to be
                                                    revered, to make people bow before those who cannot harm or benefit
                                                    them, and to divert people from the path of Allah. We understand
                                                    that Allah’s way of worship is to follow precisely what He has
                                                    prescribed through His Messenger. Another objective is not to give
                                                    these places a unique position for gatherings. Due to frequent
                                                    visits, they have become places of assembly.</p>

                                                <p style="font-style: italic;">Genuine Graves</p>

                                                <p>Most of the graves of saints are not genuine. Genuine graves are
                                                    rare. Some scholars believe that the only genuine grave of a
                                                    messenger is that of Prophet Muhammad. There is also an argument
                                                    that Prophet Ibrahim’s grave is genuine. We have confirmed reports
                                                    about the graves of particular saints. However, it is difficult to
                                                    pinpoint the exact location of these graves. For instance, we know
                                                    that many Companions are buried in Bab al-Sagheer in Damascus, but
                                                    due to multiple disturbances over time, their graves cannot be
                                                    accurately identified. Even if we are sure about the precise
                                                    location of a specific grave, this does not justify any acts of
                                                    innovation at that site.</p>

                                                <p style="font-style: italic;">Action Without Knowledge</p>

                                                <p>Engaging in action and worship without knowledge is more desirable
                                                    than engaging in action and worship against knowledge. If Sharīʿa
                                                    had sanctified reverence for graves, steps would have been taken to
                                                    preserve the record of graves. The Muslim Ummah, whose faith is
                                                    perfect, would have also been blessed with knowledge about graves.
                                                    In general, custodians of graves circulate fantastic reports about
                                                    the excellence of graves and shrines under their charge. They earn
                                                    their livelihood through these practices and unlawfully consume
                                                    others’ earnings. They are also guilty of diverting people from the
                                                    path of Allah.</p>

                                                <p>Stories like someone asking for something at a grave and having their
                                                    request readily granted by Allah or someone making a vow and
                                                    fulfilling their desire are familiar. Idolatry gained popularity in
                                                    the same way. Idolaters in India make vows to idols, and some of
                                                    their wishes are occasionally fulfilled by chance, which they
                                                    attribute to the favour of the idols.</p>

                                                <p style="font-style: italic;">Vows or Offerings</p>

                                                <p>It is recorded that the Prophet forbade making vows as they bring no
                                                    benefit. Making vows in legal matters is useless as Allah only makes
                                                    a miser spend his money in this way. Furthermore, graves cannot harm
                                                    or benefit anyone, so making illegal vows at graves serves no
                                                    purpose.</p>

                                                <p style="font-style: italic;">Erecting Shrines</p>

                                                <p>Under the second category, some places have something special about
                                                    them, but they should not be considered shrines or places for
                                                    offering prayers and other acts of worship. These are places where
                                                    the graves of the Prophets and saints are located. Such a practice
                                                    is condemned by the Prophet, both implicitly and explicitly.
                                                    According to a report by Abu Huraira recorded in Abu Daud’s
                                                    collection, the Prophet said, “Do not turn your houses into graves.
                                                    Do not take my grave as a gathering place, but rather send blessings
                                                    upon me. Your blessings will reach me, no matter where you are”
                                                    (Sunan Abi Dawud, 2042).</p>

                                                <p style="font-style: italic;">Sending Blessings at the Prophet’s Grave</p>

                                                <p>Some individuals doubt the credibility of one of the narrators of
                                                    this Ḥadīth. However, the Ḥadīth remains authentic, as other sources
                                                    also report it. For example, Abul Al-Ala reports, based on the
                                                    authority of Zayn al-Abidīn, that he witnessed someone visiting and
                                                    supplicating near the Prophet’s grave. Zayn al-Abidīn prohibited
                                                    this act and narrated the Ḥadīth he had received from his father and
                                                    grandfather: “The Prophet said, ‘Do not turn my grave into a place
                                                    of gathering and do not turn your houses into graves. Your blessings
                                                    upon me will reach me no matter where you are.'” (Sunan Abi Dawud,
                                                    2042).</p>

                                                <p>According to the report narrated by Sohail Ibn Ali Suhail, Hasan,
                                                    Ali’s grandson, saw him near the Prophet’s grave. Hasan invited Ali
                                                    to have food, but Ali declined the invitation. Hasan then asked Ali
                                                    in surprise about his visit to the Prophet’s grave. Ali replied that
                                                    he had been there to send blessings. He advised Hasan to send
                                                    blessings when entering the mosque instead, quoting the Prophet’s
                                                    words:</p>

                                                <p>“Do not make my grave a place of gathering. You should send blessings
                                                    on me, which will reach me no matter how far you are. Allah’s curse
                                                    be upon the Jews who turned the graves of the Prophets into places
                                                    of worship” (Iqtidā’ aṣ-Ṣirāṭ al-Mustaqīm li-Mukhālafat Aṣḥāb
                                                    al-Jahīm).</p>

                                                <p>Aisha reported that Umm Habibah and Umm Salamah mentioned a church
                                                    they saw in Abyssinia with graven images. They mentioned it to the
                                                    Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and he said, “Verily, when
                                                    a righteous man among them would die, they would build a place of
                                                    worship over his grave and carve these images within it. They will
                                                    be the worst to Allah on the Day of Resurrection” (Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī

                                                <p>Ibn Abdul Barr explained the reasoning for this prohibition, writing:
                                                    “The Messenger of Allah warned his companions and the rest of his
                                                    nation from the evil deeds of nations who prayed over the graves of
                                                    their prophets and took them as directions and places of prayer,
                                                    just as the idolaters used to prostrate to them and revere them.
                                                    That is the greater idolatry (al-shirk al-akbar). The Prophet told
                                                    them that it displeases Allah, angers Him, and He is not pleased
                                                    with it, fearing that they would mimic their ways” (al-Tamhīd 5/45).

                                                <p>Several authentic reports from the Prophet (ṣ) and his companions
                                                    stress the importance of prohibiting places of worship in or around
                                                    graves. Jundub reported: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon
                                                    him, said: “Verily, those before you would take the graves of their
                                                    prophets and righteous as places of prayer. Do not take graves as
                                                    places of prayer. I forbid you from doing so” (Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim 532).
                                                </p>

                                                <p>It is important to note that although the Prophet’s grave is
                                                    considered the most revered grave on earth, he forbade people from
                                                    gathering there. Therefore, it can be inferred that assembling at
                                                    all other graves would be even more strictly prohibited. Besides
                                                    forbidding his grave from becoming a gathering place, the Prophet
                                                    advised people not to turn their houses into graves. This means that
                                                    a house becomes like a grave if prayers, supplications, and
                                                    recitation of the Qur’an are not performed there. He directed that
                                                    most acts of worship be performed at home rather than near graves,
                                                    as some so-called Muslims do, following the practices of
                                                    unbelievers. According to Abdullah Ibn ʾUmar, the Prophet said: “You
                                                    should offer some of your prayers at home and not make them like
                                                    graves.” (Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī 432).</p>

                                                <p>Besides prohibiting the turning of the Prophet’s grave into a shrine
                                                    visited frequently by many people, he instructed that blessings be
                                                    sent upon him, which would reach him regardless of distance. Another
                                                    report confirms that one’s blessings would be conveyed to him no
                                                    matter where one is. Therefore, it is not appropriate to turn his
                                                    grave into a shrine that is frequently visited by a large number of
                                                    people. Our blessings on the Prophet are conveyed to him, as stated
                                                    in several Ḥadīths. Abu Hurairah reported on the authority of Abu
                                                    Daud that the Prophet said, “Whoever greets me, his greetings would
                                                    be conveyed to my soul, and I would return his greeting” (Sunan Abu
                                                    Dawood, 2041).</p>

                                                <p>Abu Daud also recorded a report by Aws Ibn Aws in which the Prophet
                                                    said, “Send more blessings on me on Friday night and day, as they
                                                    will be presented before me.” When the Companions asked how their
                                                    blessings would be presented to him after his death, he replied,
                                                    “Allah has forbidden the earth from consuming the body of His
                                                    Messengers.” (al-Sunan al-Kubrá 5854). The expression “Eid” used in
                                                    the Prophet’s ḥadīth refers to a place intentionally chosen by
                                                    people to gather, especially for worship. For example, Allah has
                                                    designated the Sacred Mosque, Mina, Muzdalifah, and ʾArafa as places
                                                    where people gather for supplication, worship, and remembrance of
                                                    Allah. The polytheists also had specific places designated for this
                                                    purpose. However, with the advent of Islam, these places lost all
                                                    their sanctity.</p>

                                                <p style="font-style: italic;">Saint’s Graves</p>

                                                <p>The same principle applies to the graves of Messengers and saints,
                                                    whether authentic or counterfeit. This rule applies to the graves of
                                                    all Muslims. According to the Sunna, it is essential to show respect
                                                    for a Muslim’s grave, as it serves as the final resting place of the
                                                    deceased. Therefore, one should refrain from littering or stepping
                                                    on it. The Ulamadiscourage sitting or reclining on graves and
                                                    avoiding disrespectful words or actions near graves is also
                                                    essential. When visiting graves, offering blessings and prayers for
                                                    the deceased is recommended. The level of obligation may vary
                                                    depending on one’s status.</p>

                                                <p style="font-style: italic;">Supplication for the Dead</p>

                                                <p>Burayda narrates that when the companions went to the graveyard, the
                                                    Prophet directed them to make this supplication: “Greetings be upon
                                                    the believing and Muslim inhabitants of this place. We will meet you
                                                    soon if Allah wills. We seek peace for you and us.” (Sahih Muslim).
                                                    According to Ibn Abbas, on observing the graveyard in Madina, the
                                                    Prophet said: “Peace be upon you, O inhabitants of graves! May Allah
                                                    forgive you and us. You preceded us, and we are to follow you”
                                                    (Bulugh al-Maram 595).</p>

                                                <p>According to Ḥadīth, it is learned that the Prophet offered funeral
                                                    prayers for the martyrs of Uhud eight years after the battle. Abu
                                                    Daud, on the authority of Uthman, relates that after burying the
                                                    dead, the Prophet faced the grave and directed his companions,
                                                    saying: “Seek forgiveness and steadfastness for your brother, as he
                                                    is about to be questioned.”</p>

                                                <p>This was the conduct of the Prophet that he directed his Ummah to
                                                    follow. He would do the same whenever he buried the dead, visited
                                                    graves, or passed by them. He would greet them as he did the living
                                                    ones. Additionally, this constitutes a supplication for the dead,
                                                    similar to how one offers supplication for living beings. While
                                                    praying for the dead, one prays for oneself and all Muslims. This
                                                    was also the practice of the Prophet and the early Muslims. Sharīʿa
                                                    prescribes this practice; his companions followed the same when
                                                    visiting the Prophet’s grave.</p>

                                                <p>Ibn Batta relates that someone asked Nafi’ about Ibn ʾUmar visiting
                                                    the Prophet’s grave; he reported that when Ibn ʾUmar arrived on his
                                                    journey, he would enter the mosque of Medina and then go to the
                                                    graves. Ibn ʾUmar would say, “Peace be upon you, O Messenger of
                                                    Allah. Peace be upon you, O Abu Bakr. Peace be upon you, O my
                                                    father” (al-Sunan al-Kubrá lil-Bayhaqī 10271).</p>

                                                <p style="font-style: italic;">Visiting Graves</p>

                                                <p>Visiting graves, even the graves of unbelievers, is permissible. In a
                                                    narration by Abu Hurairah in the collection of Muslims, it is
                                                    reported that the Prophet said: “I asked Allah’s permission to pray
                                                    for the forgiveness of my mother, but it was denied. However, I was
                                                    allowed to visit her grave” (Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim 976b).</p>

                                                <p>It is also reported in Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim that when the Prophet visited the
                                                    grave of his mother, he cried so much that it moved others to tears.
                                                    He then said, “I sought Allah’s permission to pray for her
                                                    forgiveness, but it was refused. However, visiting graves has been
                                                    permitted. Therefore, visit graves as it reminds one of death”
                                                    (Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim 976). The Prophet said, “I had previously prohibited
                                                    you from visiting graves. Now, however, you may visit them” (Sunan
                                                    Ibn Mājah 1571).</p>

                                                <p style="font-style: italic;">Visiting an Unbeliever’s Grave</p>

                                                <p>From the above Ḥadīth, it is clear that the Prophet initially
                                                    prohibited visiting graves but later permitted it. This change in
                                                    his stance occurred because such visits serve as a reminder of death
                                                    and the Hereafter. The Prophet’s permission applies to both Muslim
                                                    and non-Muslim graves, allowing Muslims to visit the graves of both.
                                                    The purpose served by visiting a grave can be attained regardless of
                                                    whether it is the grave of a Muslim or a non-Muslim. Therefore, it
                                                    is permissible to do so. However, forgiveness may only be sought for
                                                    a Muslim by the Prophet’s Sunna, as it is exclusive to Muslims.
                                                    Nevertheless, a reminder of death can still be obtained from the
                                                    grave of a non-Muslim.</p>

                                                <p style="font-style: italic;">Undertaking a Journey to Visit Graves</p>

                                                <p>There is a disagreement among the Ulama regarding the permissibility
                                                    of undertaking a journey to visit graves. Some ulama consider it
                                                    impermissible and a sin because they view it as an innovation. They
                                                    argue that early Muslims did not undertake such journeys. According
                                                    to a Ḥadīth cited in Al-Bukhari and Muslim, one may only journey to
                                                    the Ka’aba, the Prophet’s Mosque, and Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.
                                                    This directive is general and applies to all journeys, whether for
                                                    visiting a mosque, a tomb, or any other place seeking Allah’s
                                                    pleasure. To support their view, these Ulamacite the following
                                                    report: When Abi Basrah saw Abu Huraira returning from Mount Tur,
                                                    the place where Allah had spoken to Prophet Moses, he said, “Had I
                                                    seen you before going there, you would not have undertaken this
                                                    journey.” The Prophet said, “A journey can only be undertaken to
                                                    visit three mosques.”</p>

                                                <p>Based on this Ḥadīth, Abi Basrah concluded that Mount Tur and similar
                                                    places fall into the category of places for which one should not
                                                    undertake a journey. The same applies to undertaking a journey to
                                                    visit a mosque other than the three specified in the Ḥadīth.</p>

                                                <p>On the other hand, another group of Ulama considers such a journey
                                                    permissible. Scholars like Al-Ghazzali and others hold this view
                                                    from the later period. However, this view is not shared by any
                                                    classical scholar. According to them, the directive is not absolute,
                                                    and a journey undertaken to visit one’s parents, scholars, friends,
                                                    or for other permissible worldly matters is perfectly acceptable.
                                                    However, all scholars agree that committing innovation at graves is
                                                    unlawful.</p>

                                                <p style="font-style: italic;">Mosques at Graves</p>

                                                <p>It is strictly forbidden to pray near graves, consider graves as
                                                    mosques, or erect mosques at graves. The Qur’an and Sunna
                                                    categorically prohibit these actions. All scholars unanimously
                                                    prohibit the construction of mosques at graves. Hanbali, Maliki, and
                                                    Shafi’i scholars deem it unlawful, while others consider it
                                                    undesirable. However, there is no doubt that such acts are
                                                    forbidden. A Ḥadīth in the collection of Muslim, narrated by Jundub,
                                                    reported: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said,
                                                    “Verily, those before you would take the graves of their prophets
                                                    and righteous as places of prayer. Do not take graves as places of
                                                    prayer. I forbid you from doing so” (Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim 532).</p>

                                                <p>Therefore, mosques built at the graves of Prophets, saints, and kings
                                                    are unlawful. All scholars agree that it is undesirable to pray in
                                                    such mosques. Hanbalis consider prayers offered in such mosques
                                                    unacceptable due to the Prophet’s prohibition and curse.</p>

                                                <p>The matter becomes even more severe if such a mosque is built on
                                                    unlawful land. For example, some mosques have been built at the
                                                    graves of saints by usurping land or converting a madrasah for this
                                                    purpose. Such actions violate many rules, such as:</p>

                                                <p>1. The land of a graveyard should only be used for burying dead
                                                    bodies and cannot be used for any other purpose.</p>

                                                <p>2. A mosque cannot be built on a public thoroughfare.</p>

                                                <p>3. The graves of other Muslims are sometimes dug and removed to make
                                                    space for such buildings.</p>

                                                <p>4. Public toilets are attached to such buildings, which is
                                                    inappropriate as the graves of Muslims should be kept away from
                                                    impurity.</p>

                                                <p>5. Taking graves as mosques is forbidden.</p>

                                                <p>6. Lighting lamps at graves is cursed, according to the Prophet.</p>

                                                <p>7. Such practices imitate the ways and rituals of the People of the
                                                    Book.</p>

                                                <p>It is worth noting that while religious scholars strongly object to
                                                    wearing attire resembling that of unbelievers, they do not object to
                                                    practices that imitate the ways of unbelievers, possibly because
                                                    some religious scholars benefit from such acts.</p>

                                                <p>In conclusion, the exploration of ‘bidʿa’ in Islamic jurisprudence
                                                    reveals a multifaceted and dynamic aspect of Islamic history and
                                                    religious practice. The concept, originating as a means to ensure
                                                    fidelity to the practices of Prophet Muhammad, has evolved through
                                                    various interpretations by classical and later scholars, reflecting
                                                    a spectrum from acceptance to stringent rejection. This evolution
                                                    mirrors the broader historical, theological, and political
                                                    developments within the Islamic world, from the Umayyad and Abbasid
                                                    eras to contemporary times. Diverse schools of thought, including
                                                    Sufism and rationalist movements like the Mu’tazila, have
                                                    contributed to this rich tapestry of understanding, often in
                                                    response to the practical challenges of governing and maintaining
                                                    religious integrity. Practices such as the celebration of Mawlid and
                                                    the institutionalization of Tarāwīh prayers highlight the ongoing
                                                    relevance and complexity of ‘bidʿa’ in shaping Muslim religious
                                                    life. The paper underscores the importance of contextual and
                                                    authentic interpretation, calling attention to the nuanced role that
                                                    ‘bidʿa’ plays in the continuity and adaptation of Islamic
                                                    traditions. This discussion not only enhances our understanding of
                                                    Islamic jurisprudence but also invites reflection on the broader
                                                    themes of innovation, tradition, and the dynamic nature of religious
                                                    practice.</p>
