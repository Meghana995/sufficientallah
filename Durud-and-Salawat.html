                                            </h4>
                                            <div>

                                                <p>The Darūd and Ṣalawāt are practices of invoking blessings upon the
                                                    Prophet Muḥammad. For some Muslims, these practices hold great
                                                    significance in their daily lives and are integral to prayer
                                                    rituals. The origins of Darūd and Ṣalawāt can be traced back to the
                                                    Qurʾān and the Ḥadīth. In the Qurʾān, Allāh commands Muslims to ṣalī
                                                    upon the Prophet:</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ وَمَلَـٰٓئِكَتَهُۥ يُصَلُّونَ عَلَى ٱلنَّبِىِّ ۚ
                                                    يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ صَلُّوا۟ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلِّمُوا۟
                                                    تَسْلِيمًا ٥٦</p>

                                                <p>“Allāh and His angels ṣalī the Prophet- so, you who believe, ṣalī him
                                                    too and give him greetings of peace”.1</p>

                                                <p>The command in this verse forms the basis of the Ṣalawāt practice.
                                                    The term Ṣalawāt is derived from the Arabic root “ṣ-l-w,” which
                                                    means “to pray”. Therefore, the practice of Ṣalawāt is sending
                                                    prayers and blessings upon the Prophet.2</p>

                                                <p>“When a third of the night had passed, the Messenger of Allāh stood
                                                    and said: ‘O you people! Remember Allāh! Remember Allāh! The Rajifah
                                                    is coming, followed by the Radifah, death and what it brings is
                                                    coming, death and what it brings is coming!'” Ubayy said: “I said:
                                                    ‘O Messenger of Allāh! Indeed, I say very much Salat for you. How
                                                    much of my Salat should I make for you?’ He said: ‘As you wish.'” “I
                                                    said: ‘A fourth?’ He said: ‘As you wish. But if you add more, it
                                                    would be better for you.’ I said: ‘Then half?’ He said: ‘As you
                                                    wish. And if you add more, it would be better.'”, “I said: ‘Then
                                                    two-thirds? ‘He said: ‘As you wish, but if you add more, it would be
                                                    better for you.’ I said: ‘Should I make all of my Salat for you?’ He
                                                    said: ‘Then your problems would be solved, and your sins would be
                                                    forgiven.’” 3</p>

                                                <p>Nonetheless, it is crucial to highlight that this ḥadīth was
                                                    exclusively imparted to a single companion, with no others receiving
                                                    this counsel. Furthermore, as will be demonstrated, this ḥadīth is
                                                    frequently subject to significant misinterpretation.</p>

                                                <p>The Darūd, on the other hand, is rooted in the ḥadīth literature. The
                                                    term Darūd is derived from the Persian language, which means
                                                    “praising” or “invoking blessings.” The practice of Darūd, while in
                                                    effect equivalent to Ṣalawāt, is usually reserved for practices
                                                    revolving around sending blessings upon the Prophet following a
                                                    specific formula found in the ḥadīth:</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">اَللّٰھُمَّ صَلِّ عَلٰی مُحَمَّدٍ وَّعَلٰٓی اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ کَمَا
                                                    صَلَّیْتَ عَلٰٓی اِبْرَاھِیْمَ وَعَلٰٓی اٰلِ اِبْرَاھِیْمَ اِنَّکَ
                                                    حَمِیْدٌ مَّجِیْدٌ اَللّٰھُمَّ بَارِکْ عَلٰی مُحَمَّدٍ وَّعَلٰٓی
                                                    اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ کَمَا بَارَکْتَ عَلٰٓی اِبْرَاھِیْمَ وَعَلٰٓی اٰلِ
                                                    اِبْرَاھِیْمَ اِنَّکَ حَمِیْدٌ مَّجِیْدٌ</p>

                                                <p>“O Allāh, ṣalī Muḥammad and the family of Muḥammad, as You ṣalī
                                                    Ibrahim and the family of Ibrahim. Grant blessings to Muḥammad and
                                                    the family of Muḥammad, as You granted blessings to Ibrahim and the
                                                    family of Ibrahim. In all the worlds, indeed, You are praiseworthy
                                                    and exalted”. 4</p>

                                                <p>Darūd and Ṣalawāt have been emphasised by the Prophet himself, who
                                                    encouraged his followers to send blessings upon him:</p>

                                                <p>“Whoever sends blessings upon me once, Allāh will send blessings upon
                                                    him ten times”. 5</p>

                                                <p>Nevertheless, numerous individuals carry this practice to excess,
                                                    inadvertently equating the Prophet with Allāh instead of upholding
                                                    His pre-eminence. It is imperative to comprehend that only Allāh
                                                    merits being positioned at the core and the forefront of our
                                                    devotional activities, as proclaimed, “Exalted be Allāh, the true
                                                    King, there is no Allāh but Him, the Lord of the magnificent
                                                    throne”. 6</p>


                                                <p>These practices have an apparent propensity to lead to excessive
                                                    veneration of the Prophet Muḥammad, which border on idolatry, and
                                                    distract Muslims from the worship of Allāh and, instead, focus their
                                                    devotion on the Prophet. Any practice that diverts attention from
                                                    Allāh and places it on another being, even a highly revered figure
                                                    such as the Prophet Muḥammad, could potentially violate the
                                                    fundamental principle of tawḥīd. Ultimately, what is apparent
                                                    amongst the practices of modern Muslims is an emphasis on sending
                                                    blessings where the Prophet is elevated to a status that is equal to
                                                    or near that of Allāh.</p>

                                                <p>While the practice of Ṣalawāt is grounded in the Qurʾān and Sunna,
                                                    the way these are practised today is the result of external
                                                    influences on Muslims. The rituals associated with sending blessings
                                                    upon the Prophet have been inspired by practices from other
                                                    religious traditions, such as Christianity, where the veneration of
                                                    saints and religious figures plays a significant role. Furthermore,
                                                    the practice of Ṣalawāt has its roots in Sufi mysticism, which
                                                    emphasises the spiritual connection between the believer and the
                                                    Prophet and often incorporates rituals that are not explicitly
                                                    mentioned in the Qurʾān or Ḥadīth.</p>

                                                <p>Christians often invoke the intercession of saints through prayers
                                                    and devotional acts, seeking their assistance in attaining spiritual
                                                    blessings and protection. This practice might have influenced the
                                                    development of Ṣalawāt in Islam, leading to a similar focus on
                                                    seeking blessings and divine favour through the veneration of the
                                                    Prophet Muḥammad. Incorporating non-Islamic practices into Islam
                                                    could potentially dilute the essence of Islamic monotheism and
                                                    contribute to the elevation of the Prophet to a status comparable to
                                                    Allāh.</p>

                                                <p>Sufi mysticism is characterised by its emphasis on the spiritual
                                                    connection between the believer and the Prophet. Sufism often
                                                    incorporates rituals and practices that are not explicitly mentioned
                                                    in the Qurʾān or Ḥadīth, such as the recitation of divine names
                                                    (dhikr) and the performance of sacred dances (samā‘). The practice
                                                    of Ṣalawāt, as observed in Sufi circles, might have originated from
                                                    these mystical traditions. The spiritual experiences and states of
                                                    consciousness associated with Sufi practices could have contributed
                                                    to the development of Ṣalawāt as a means of connecting with the
                                                    Prophet and seeking his spiritual guidance and intercession. These
                                                    forms of Ṣalawāt contain additional phrases not found in the
                                                    original texts of the Qurʾān and Ḥadīth. Incorporating these
                                                    supplemental phrases into the practice constitutes a deviation from
                                                    the authentic teachings of Islam.</p>

                                                <p>Furthermore, these practices promote ritualism, which detracts from
                                                    the spiritual aspects of Islamic worship. The focus on reciting
                                                    specific formulas of Ṣalawāt may lead to these practices’ mechanical
                                                    and superficial performance without fully understanding their
                                                    meaning and significance. How these practices are observed leads to
                                                    developing a “cult of personality” surrounding the Prophet. The
                                                    excessive focus on the Prophet might encourage Muslims to view him
                                                    as an intercessor or intermediary between them and Allāh, which
                                                    could undermine the Islamic principle of direct communication
                                                    between the believer and Allāh. This concern is particularly
                                                    relevant in Islamic mysticism and Sufi practices, where the Prophet
                                                    is often regarded as the ultimate spiritual guide and source of
                                                    divine knowledge.</p>

                                                <p>Some Muslims go beyond the intended meanings of these verses and seek
                                                    to equate Allāh and His Prophet to the same level, despite the
                                                    cautionary behaviour of the Prophet himself. By observing how the
                                                    prophets behaved and how particular they were with wording, for
                                                    instance, Al-Tufayl reported: A man among the idolaters said to a
                                                    man among the Muslims, “How excellent it would be of your people if
                                                    you said: What Allāh wills and Muḥammad wills.” The Prophet heard
                                                    him, and he said, “Do not say: What Allāh wills and Muḥammad wills.
                                                    Rather, say: What Allāh wills, and then what Muḥammad wills.”
                                                    Hudhayfah reported: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him,
                                                    said, “Do not say: What Allāh wills and this person wills. Rather
                                                    you should say: What Allāh wills, then what this person wills.12”
                                                </p>


                                                <p>The Prophets of Allāh were fierce in their loyalty to the Most High;
                                                    all motivations were for Allāh – and the language and messaging they
                                                    used never changed. In these two Ḥadīth, the Prophet wants to
                                                    distinguish between the will of Allāh and the will of humans; here,
                                                    the intention is clear. Ultimately all rests on the will of Allāh
                                                    alone, and as such, no one can be a partner in this degree of will.
                                                    A person may be included in addition, i.e., ‘What Allāh wills, then
                                                    what this person wills’ due to causality. For instance, Allāh wills
                                                    a cure for you, but you are cured through the doctor willing to
                                                    treat you. This effort of the noble Prophet Muḥammad to remove
                                                    himself as equal to Allāh is even more so apparent in another
                                                    variation of the Ḥadīth; Ibn Abbas reported: A man said to the
                                                    Prophet, “What Allāh wills and you will!” The Prophet said, “Do you
                                                    make me equal to Allāh? Rather, what Allāh wills alone.”13</p>

                                                <p>The Prophet’s particularity in wants to keep his rank and Allāh’s
                                                    rank separate does not stop here and can be seen in numerous
                                                    reports; for instance, Qutaylah reported: A Jewish man came to the
                                                    Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and he said, “Indeed, you
                                                    are setting up rivals with Allāh and associating partners with Him
                                                    when you say, ‘What Allāh wills and you will,’ and when you swear by
                                                    the Kaaba!” The Prophet ordered them to say when they intend to
                                                    swear an oath, “By the Lord of the Kaaba,” and for them to say,
                                                    “What Allāh wills and then what you will”.14</p>

                                                <p>“Mother of Allāh and Virgin, rejoice, Mary full of grace, the Lord is
                                                    with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit
                                                    of thy womb, for thou hast given birth to the Saviour of our souls”.
                                                </p>

                                                <p>And in another variation:</p>

                                                <p>“Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou
                                                    amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy
                                                    Mary, Mother of Allāh, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of
                                                    our death. Amen.”</p>

                                                <p>Christians use these liturgical statements of praise for Mary to seek
                                                    closer to God or intercession with Mary. Some Muslims use Ṣalawāt in
                                                    this same fashion raising the Prophet beyond his status. By
                                                    essentially making set dedicated prayers and supplications to the
                                                    Prophet so that they do not honour God. These same Muslims will have
                                                    Allāh and Muḥammad written on their wall and in their mosques,
                                                    setting Allāh and His Messenger as equals. In this sense, these
                                                    individuals raise the Prophet to the rank the Christians raise
                                                    Jesus. Despite the Prophet giving clear instructions against this:
                                                </p>

                                                <p>“Do not exaggerate in praising me as the Christians praised the son
                                                    of Mary, for I am only a Slave. So, call me the Slave of Allāh and

                                                <p>The Qurʾān elaborates further on how the Christians went into excess:

                                                <p>“People of the Book do not go to excess in your religion and do not
                                                    say anything about Allāh except the truth: the Messiah, Jesus, son
                                                    of Mary, was nothing more than a messenger of Allāh, His word,
                                                    directed to Mary, a spirit from Him. So, believe in Allāh and His
                                                    messengers and do not speak of a ‘Trinity’- stop [this], that is
                                                    better for you- God is only one Allāh, He is far above having a son,
                                                    everything in the heavens and earth belongs to Him and He is the
                                                    best one to trust.” 16</p>


                                                <p>Despite the prophet’s explicit differentiation between himself and
                                                    Allāh, a few individuals persist in obscuring this distinction, even
                                                    as they acknowledge that the messengers have expressed or conveyed
                                                    notions opposing the sentiment being scrutinised. These excessive
                                                    praises of the prophet go against the Qurʾān, and the practises of
                                                    the prophets. The Qurʾān instructs the prophet to ṣalī over others:
                                                </p>

                                                <p class="arabic">خُذْ مِنْ أَمْوَٰلِهِمْ صَدَقَةًۭ تُطَهِّرُهُمْ وَتُزَكِّيهِم بِهَا

                                                <p>Should we then begin to do Ṣalawāt upon new converts? Furthermore,
                                                    the Qurʾān states that besides the Prophet, Allāh sends Ṣalawāt on
                                                    all the believers:</p>

                                                <p>“Muḥammad is not the father of any one of you men; he is Allāh’s
                                                    Messenger and the seal of the prophets: Allāh knows everything.
                                                    Believers, remember Allāh often and glorify Him morning and evening:
                                                    it is He who blesses you, as do His angels, to lead you out of the
                                                    depths of darkness into the light. He is ever merciful towards the
                                                    believers”.18</p>

                                                <p>This verse states, “It is He who yuṣalī upon you” Allāh sends Ṣalawāt
                                                    upon the believers as he does the Prophet. These two verses
                                                    demonstrate that Ṣalawāt is means of blessing or praying for someone
                                                    as a means of encouragement. The sending Ṣalawāt on the Prophet is a
                                                    means of rooting for and supporting the Prophet, hence why so much
                                                    reward was encouraged for it. In our times, it is a means of
                                                    honouring him, but it is not an act to be done in excess. In the
                                                    Qurʾān verses 33:40-43, Allāh conveys that He similarly bestows upon
                                                    believers who remember and extol Him sympathy, affection, and
                                                    attachment by providing guidance and support that transitions them
                                                    from ignorance and falsehood to knowledge and truth. This verse was
                                                    a response to the complaint of the Ṣaḥāba; Ibn Abbas stated: when
                                                    “Allāh and His angels ‘ṣalat’ on the Prophet,” was revealed the
                                                    Muhājirūn and Anṣār said, ‘This is for you, O Messenger of Allāh,
                                                    exclusively, and we have nothing in it’. So, Allāh Almighty revealed
                                                    this verse.19 Furthermore, Ibn Zaid said this verse refers to Allāh
                                                    aiding the Believers from misguidance to guidance. 20</p>

                                                <p>We mentioned above that Ṣalawāt refers to honouring and rooting for
                                                    the Prophet; in our context, we show affiliation, love, and
                                                    honouring. When we mention our deceased scholars and loved ones, we
                                                    say, ‘raḥimahu llāh’ (Transl. Allāh have mercy on him). With the
                                                    Prophet, upon mentioning him or remembering him or reciting his
                                                    noble statements, we should ask Allāh to bless him and increase his
                                                    reward. The most common form of Ṣalawāt is the statement ‘ṣalli
                                                    Allāhu ʿAlayhi wa Sallam’, which translates to ‘the support and
                                                    peace of Allāh be upon him’. In essence, these are statements of
                                                    endearment; however, ‘ṣalli ʿala’ does not signify blessings, and
                                                    contrary to prevalent belief, ‘ṣalat’ is not solely associated with
                                                    supplication. The term ‘ṣalat’ in conjunction with the preposition
                                                    ʿalā’ conveys sympathy, affection, and attachment, i.e., ‘ṣalat’ is
                                                    intimately connected to the word ‘Silah’, which denotes a bond or
                                                    connection. The verse that mentions Ṣalawāt:</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ وَمَلَـٰٓئِكَتَهُۥ يُصَلُّونَ عَلَى ٱلنَّبِىِّ ۚ
                                                    يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ صَلُّوا۟ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلِّمُوا۟
                                                    تَسْلِيمًا ٥٦</p>

                                                <p>“Allāh and His angels ṣalī the Prophet- so, you who believe, ṣalī him
                                                    too and give him greetings of peace”.21</p>

                                                <p>Allāh instructed the Ṣaḥāba to champion the Prophet, support him,
                                                    treat him with affection, care for him, and advocate for him.
                                                    Although not in the Prophet’s company, present-day believers can
                                                    uphold his mission and work to perpetuate his legacy. To ‘ṣalat’ on
                                                    the Prophet may be expressed through verbalising the sentiment,
                                                    requesting from Allāh, and undertaking righteous endeavours. While
                                                    the sentiment can be articulated, ‘ṣalat’ on the Prophet entails a
                                                    feeling that precedes speech and action rather than merely uttering
                                                    a phrase. The verse does not mandate a specific phrase after every
                                                    mention. In context, the verse directs the Ṣaḥāba to support the
                                                    Prophet and safeguard his well-being, refraining from offensive
                                                    speech or conduct. Initially, the verse does not refer to uttering
                                                    any specific words. As previously discussed, ‘ṣalat’ on the Prophet
                                                    involves harbouring a sentiment of advocacy, support, affection, and
                                                    esteem, much like Allāh and the angels.</p>

                                                <p>Another act were Ṣalawāt has become missed used is duʿāʾ, a deeply
                                                    personal and spiritual endeavour, allowing believers to communicate
                                                    directly with Allah. Over time, the practice of including Ṣalawāt
                                                    and darūd within these supplications has become prevalent. The
                                                    practice of sending blessings upon the Prophet Muḥammad is rooted in
                                                    the ḥadīth literature provides further insights. Anas ibn Malik
                                                    reported that the Prophet said, “When one of you makes a duʿāʾ, let
                                                    him start by praising Allah, then let him send blessings upon the
                                                    Prophet, then let him ask for whatever he wants”.22 This ḥadīth
                                                    suggests a recommended format for duʿāʾ but does not mandate the
                                                    inclusion of Ṣalawāt as a prerequisite for its acceptance.</p>

                                                <p>A prevalent misconception is that a duʿāʾ will not be accepted unless
                                                    it includes Ṣalawāt. This belief lacks direct Qurʾānic or ḥadīthic
                                                    evidence. While the ḥadīth from al-Tirmidhī suggests a format, it
                                                    does not stipulate that omitting Ṣalawāt invalidates the duʿāʾ. The
                                                    ṣaḥāba, were known for their fervent duʿāʾs, and while many included
                                                    Ṣalawāt, there is no recorded consensus among them that it was a
                                                    requirement for the acceptance of duʿāʾ.</p>

                                                <p>Classical scholars have always emphasized moderation in religious
                                                    practices. Imam al-Nawawi, in his commentary on Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim, noted
                                                    the importance of following the Prophet’s teachings without
                                                    exaggeration or negligence. Including Ṣalawāt in duʿāʾ is
                                                    commendable, but it should not be seen as a strict requirement or be
                                                    done to the point of overshadowing the actual supplication. The
                                                    essence of duʿāʾ is to seek from Allah, and while sending blessings
                                                    upon the Prophet is meritorious, it should not dominate the
                                                    supplication to the exclusion of personal pleas and requests. The
                                                    practice of including Ṣalawāt in duʿāʾ has a basis in Islamic
                                                    tradition, but it is essential to approach it with understanding and
                                                    moderation. Misconceptions surrounding its necessity should be
                                                    addressed to ensure that the essence of duʿāʾ, a personal connection
                                                    with Allāh, remains undiluted.</p>

                                                <p>“Grant us good things in this world and in the life to come. We turn
                                                    to You.’ Allāh said, ‘I bring My punishment on whomever I will, but
                                                    My mercy encompasses all things. ‘I shall ordain My mercy for those
                                                    who are conscious of Allāh and pay the prescribed alms; who believe
                                                    in Our Revelations; who follow the Messenger- the unlettered Prophet
                                                    they find described in the Torah that is with them, and in the
                                                    Gospel- who commands them to do right and forbids them to do wrong,
                                                    who makes good things lawful to them and bad things unlawful, and
                                                    relieves them of their burdens, and the iron collars that were on
                                                    them. So, it is those who believe him, honour, and help him, and who
                                                    follow the light which has been sent down with him, who will
                                                    succeed.’ Say [Muḥammad], ‘People, I am the Messenger of Allāh to
                                                    you all, from Him who has control over the heavens and the earth.
                                                    There is no Allāh but Him; He gives life and death, so believe in
                                                    Allāh and His Messenger, the unlettered Prophet who believes in
                                                    Allāh and His words, and follow him so that you may find guidance’”
                                                </p>

                                                <p>Our ethical duty to Allāh entails supporting this esteemed assembly
                                                    of the Most High and venerating them. While a fundamental and
                                                    universal decorum exists, various cultures manifest ‘honouring’ in
                                                    distinct ways, and we respect their prerogative to do so. However,
                                                    individuals with residual pagan inclinations obscure the demarcation
                                                    between humans and Allāh, as their conception of ‘honouring’ a
                                                    Prophet borders on deification. Although overt acts, such as
                                                    flagrant idolatry, may be deemed unacceptable, the heart—of
                                                    paramount importance—appears confounded regarding the appropriate
                                                    veneration for Allāh as opposed to humans, even when those humans
                                                    are Prophets.</p>
