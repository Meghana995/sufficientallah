                                                    The term ʾawliyāʾ (plural of walī) evokes an array of nuanced
                                                    interpretations, reflecting diverse social, theological and mystic
                                                    elements; derived from the Arabic root w-l-y, denoting closeness or
                                                    friendship, ʾawliyāʾ broadly refers to the ‘friends of Allāh’,
                                                    individuals who have attained a special status due to their
                                                    perceived proximity to the divine. Yet, the definition is
                                                    deceptively simple for a richly nuanced term. Rooted in the Arabic
                                                    language, ‘walī’ embodies a myriad of meanings, including
                                                    ‘custodian’, ‘protector’, ‘helper’, and ‘friend’. However, the term
                                                    frequently denotes an Islamic saint, otherwise referred to by the
                                                    more literal ‘friend of God’. The Qurʾān offers profound insights
                                                    into the concept of ʾawliyāʾ, providing the foundational framework
                                                    for understanding this term. Several verses explicitly use the term
                                                    ʾAwliyāʾ, elaborating on its various connotations and shaping how
                                                    the concept has been interpreted over the centuries.

                                                    fear, nor shall they grieve. For those who believe and are conscious

                                                    This verse underpins the fundamental association of ʾAwliyāʾ with
                                                    belief and piety and their consequent security from fear and grief.
                                                    These attributes reflect the intimate relationship between the
                                                    ʾAwliyāʾ and the divine, expressed through their elevated spiritual
                                                    status. The Qurʾān provided the initial religious context for the
                                                    concept of ʾawliyāʾ. The following verse,

                                                <p>
                                                    “God is the ally of those who believe: He brings them out of the
                                                    depths of darkness and into the light. As for the disbelievers,
                                                    their allies are false gods who take them from the light into the
                                                    depths of darkness, they are the inhabitants of the Fire, and there
                                                    they will remain”.3
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Allāh is depicted as the ‘walī’ in this verse, guiding believers out
                                                    of darkness into the light. The implications of this verse are
                                                    profound as it emphasises that true guidance is solely the domain of
                                                    Allāh, and those who believe and seek His protection become
                                                    recipients of His light – thus becoming ʾawliyāʾ. Another crucial
                                                    verse is,

                                                    who keep up the prayer, pay the prescribed alms, and bow down in

                                                    The verse highlights the connection between Allāh, His messenger,
                                                    and the believers – implying a shared guardianship or friendship and
                                                    thus reinforcing the notion of the ʾawliyāʾ. Each of these verses
                                                    underscores the theological foundation for the concept of ʾawliyāʾ,
                                                    suggesting that the ʾawliyāʾ of Allāh are those who are steadfast in
                                                    their faith, demonstrate fear of Allāh, and follow His guidance.
                                                    They contribute to a multi-dimensional understanding of ʾawliyāʾ –
                                                    as guardians, friends, and those with a profound, intimate
                                                    relationship with the divine.

                                                    These Qurʾānic references established the foundational meaning of
                                                    ʾawliyāʾ as individuals of
                                                    strong faith and righteousness who enjoy a close relationship with
                                                    God. Ḥadīth literature
                                                    further elaborates on the term ʾawliyāʾ. A famous ḥadīth recounts
                                                    Allāh saying, “Whosoever
                                                    shows enmity to someone devoted to Me, I shall be at war with him.
                                                    My servant draws not
                                                    near to Me with anything more loved by Me than the religious duties
                                                    I have enjoined upon
                                                    him, and My servant continues to draw near to Me with supererogatory
                                                    works so that I shall love him. When I love him, I am his hearing
                                                    with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with
                                                    which he strikes and his foot with which he walks. Were he to ask
                                                    something of Me, I would surely give it to him, and if he asked Me
                                                    for refuge, I would grant it to him. I do not hesitate about
                                                    anything as much as I hesitate about seizing the soul of My faithful
                                                    servant: he hates death, and I hate hurting him”.5 This ḥadīth
                                                    encapsulates the transcendental relationship between the ʾAwliyāʾ
                                                    and Allāh, where the former embodies the divine attributes through
                                                    continual devotion. Several ḥadīths provide critical insights into
                                                    the spiritual and moral characteristics of ʾawliyāʾ and their
                                                    relationships with Allāh. In another ḥadīth, Prophet Muḥammad
                                                    states: “One who is hostile to a friend (‘walī’) of Mine I declare
                                                    war against”. 6 This ḥadīth highlights the special protective
                                                    relationship between Allāh and His ʾawliyāʾ. It suggests that the
                                                    ʾawliyāʾ, due to their close relationship with Allāh, are under His
                                                    divine protection, with hostility towards them considered as
                                                    hostility towards Allāh Himself. The Prophet also said, “Allāh said:
                                                    ‘I will declare war against him who shows hostility to a ‘walī’ of
                                                    Mine’”. 7 This ḥadīth reinforces the protective relationship Allāh
                                                    has with His ʾawliyāʾ and warns against any form of animosity
                                                    directed towards them.

                                                    A famous ḥadīth reported by Tirmiḏhī adds further nuances to the
                                                    understanding of ʾawliyāʾ. It reads: “The ʾawliyāʾ of Allāh are
                                                    those when they are seen, Allāh is remembered”.8 This ḥadīth implies
                                                    that the ʾawliyāʾ have such a profound influence on others that
                                                    their very presence invokes the remembrance of Allāh. It underscores
                                                    the spiritual impact and significance of the ʾawliyāʾ in the broader
                                                    Muslim community.

                                                    The ḥadīth literature provides us with a portrayal of ʾawliyāʾ not
                                                    merely as pious individuals but as entities with an intensely
                                                    intimate connection with Allāh, reaching a level where their actions
                                                    reflect divine guidance and will.

                                                    The notion of ʾAwliyāʾ, while simple in its semantic essence, is
                                                    deeply woven into the fabric of Islamic history, theology, and
                                                    mysticism. Its origins trace back to the earliest periods of Islamic
                                                    thought when scholars sought to articulate and define the parameters
                                                    of sainthood. These early saints were often portrayed as individuals
                                                    marked by the special divine favour and holiness, chosen by God and
                                                    endowed with exceptional gifts such as the ability to work miracles.
                                                    Over time, their graves turned into pilgrimage centres, attracting
                                                    vast numbers of Muslims seeking their ‘baraka’ (blessing).

                                                    From the formative period of Islam, the concept of ʾAwliyāʾ has
                                                    undergone significant evolution and reinterpretation. It underwent a
                                                    profound metamorphosis during the Umayyad Caliphate (661–750),
                                                    reflecting a growing spiritual urge to counter the worldliness of
                                                    the political establishment. However, the concept started to take
                                                    shape during the rapid expansion of the mystical trend of Sufism.
                                                    Many figures who later came to be regarded as major saints in
                                                    orthodox Sunni Islam were early Sufi mystics, such as Hasan of Basra
                                                    (d. 728), Farqad Sabakhi (d. 729), Dawud Tai (d. 777–781), Rabi’a
                                                    al-‘Adawiyya (d. 801), Maruf Karkhi (d. 815), and Junayd of Baghdad
                                                    (d. 910).

                                                    As the Islamic world entered the classical period (8th-14th
                                                    century), the concept of ʾawliyāʾ was subject to deeper scrutiny and
                                                    interpretation by Islamic scholars. The understanding of ʾawliyāʾ
                                                    has evolved significantly from its initial emergence in early
                                                    Islamic literature to its current understanding within widespread
                                                    practice and academic discourse. Over time, the conceptualisation of
                                                    ʾawliyāʾ has shifted from primarily associated with close friendship
                                                    or alliance with Allāh to a complex spiritual category often
                                                    associated with miraculous deeds and divine love.

                                                    In the initial phases of Islamic development, the term ʾawliyāʾ
                                                    remained closely tied to its Qurʾānic and Ḥadīth foundations,
                                                    chiefly used to denote those enjoying a special relationship with
                                                    Allāh due to their piety and righteousness. It was during the
                                                    classical period, however, that the notion began to see significant
                                                    evolution and expansion, chiefly due to the influence of Sufi
                                                    mysticism

                                                    The emergence and subsequent rise of philosophy and Sufism as
                                                    significant facets of Islamic practice catalysed the evolution of
                                                    the ʾawliyāʾ concept. Al-Kindī, one of the first Arab philosophers
                                                    and a key figure in the translation of Greek philosophical works,
                                                    believed that the ʾawliyāʾ were those who had achieved a state of
                                                    perfect balance and harmony in their souls. He argued that this
                                                    equilibrium enabled the ʾawliyāʾ to attain spiritual excellence and
                                                    proximity to God.9 Ibn Miskawayh, a renowned ethicist and
                                                    philosopher, held a similar view. He saw the ʾawliyāʾ as those who
                                                    achieved an inner transformation through continuous moral
                                                    self-development that allowed them to reflect divine attributes in
                                                    their actions. 10 Al Fārābī and Al-Rāzī both stressed the importance
                                                    of knowledge and intellectual capacity in becoming a ‘walī’. For Al
                                                    Fārābī, the ʾawliyāʾ were the philosophers, the ones who had
                                                    attained the highest form of knowledge. 11 Al-Rāzī, on the other
                                                    hand, recognised both intellectual and spiritual components in the
                                                    making of a ‘walī’, where learning was coupled with a deep sense of
                                                    devotion. Al-Balkhi and Ibn Sina viewed the ʾawliyāʾ as individuals
                                                    who, through their moral and spiritual practices, had achieved a
                                                    state of equilibrium and harmony between their physical and
                                                    spiritual natures. They emphasised the importance of
                                                    self-purification in attaining nearness to God. Ibn Rushd, also
                                                    known as Averroes, believed in the rationality of the divine and the
                                                    ability of humans to access divine truth through intellectual
                                                    pursuit. His conception of the ʾawliyāʾ, therefore, emphasised the
                                                    importance of intellectual effort and understanding in achieving
                                                    closeness to God.12

                                                    Many Sufi orders and thinkers, including the likes of Ibn Arabi and
                                                    Jalāl ad-Dīn Rūmī, embraced the idea of ʾawliyāʾ as spiritual guides
                                                    capable of intersession and performing miracles, or Karāmāt. 13
                                                    ʾawliyāʾ were seen as being imbued with divine love and possessing
                                                    an intimate knowledge of the divine reality, hence capable of
                                                    guiding seekers along the spiritual path.14

                                                    This Sufi understanding often led to the cult of saints, where
                                                    ʾawliyāʾ were venerated, their tombs visited for blessings, and
                                                    their intercession sought. As scholars like Ernst (1997) noted, “the
                                                    function of the ʾawliyāʾ in this system was to serve as spiritual
                                                    exemplars and intercessors, whose tombs provided a tangible point of
                                                    contact with the sacred”.15

                                                    Scholars such as Al-Ghazālī, Ibn Taymiyya, and Ibn Qayyim
                                                    al-Jawziyya made significant contributions to the understanding of
                                                    ʾawliyāʾ. Al-Ghazālī, a prominent Sufi scholar, viewed ʾawliyāʾ as
                                                    the spiritual elite, individuals who had transcended beyond merely
                                                    observing religious duties and had immersed themselves in an intense
                                                    love for God.16 Ibn Taymiyya, on the other hand, while recognising
                                                    the existence and spiritual stature of ʾawliyāʾ, cautioned against
                                                    excess veneration, calling for a balanced approach in respecting
                                                    these figures. The early Islamic scholars continued the discourse on
                                                    the ʾawliyāʾ. Al-Ghazālī, a prominent Sufi scholar, further
                                                    expounded on the attributes of ʾawliyāʾ in his works. He highlighted
                                                    their exceptional levels of piety, righteousness, and adherence to
                                                    the Sharīʿa as characteristics of true ʾawliyāʾ. 17 Ibn Taymiyya
                                                    emphasised the recognition of ʾawliyāʾ as solely within God’s
                                                    domain, arguing against the excessive veneration of individuals as
                                                    ʾawliyāʾ. 18 Ibn Taymiyya understood the concept of ʾawliyāʾ within
                                                    the framework of the Qurʾānic verse,

                                                    For Ibn Taymiyya, the ʾawliyāʾ were the pious servants of Allāh,
                                                    those who had a deep, abiding faith in Allāh and rigorously followed
                                                    the tenets of Islam. He emphasised that being a ‘walī’ of Allāh was
                                                    not predicated on performing extraordinary miracles or supernatural
                                                    feats but rather on a profound level of piety and an unwavering
                                                    commitment to the Sharīʿa.

                                                    He underscored the importance of spiritual purity and rigorous
                                                    adherence to the Qurʾān and Sunna as the prerequisites of wilaya
                                                    (sainthood). As he stated in his seminal work, Majmu’ alFatāwā,
                                                    “The saints are those who follow the Book and the Sunnah and are
                                                    guided by the light of prophetic knowledge”. 20 In this view, the
                                                    ʾawliyāʾ are the paragons of Islamic spirituality, exemplifying a
                                                    deep commitment to following the path of righteousness as laid down
                                                    in the Qurʾān and the Sunna.

                                                <p>
                                                    Ibn Taymiyya vehemently criticised practices associated with the
                                                    veneration of ʾawliyāʾ, such
                                                    as shrine visitations and seeking intercession through the saints.
                                                    He viewed these practices as divergent from the monotheistic
                                                    principles, even bordering on shirk. His concern was that excessive
                                                    reverence for ʾawliyāʾ could lead to an elevation of these
                                                    individuals to a status that should be exclusively reserved for
                                                    Allāh.

                                                    However, despite his stringent views, Ibn Taymiyya did not deny the
                                                    possibility of Karāmāt among the ʾawliyāʾ. He posited that Karāmāt
                                                    could occur as a divine blessing for the righteous. Yet, he
                                                    cautioned believers against interpreting any extraordinary
                                                    occurrences as signs of an individual’s status as a ‘walī’,
                                                    reiterating that only Allāh could truly know the status of a ‘walī’.

                                                    As the Islamic empire expanded across vast territories,
                                                    incorporating numerous cultures, languages, and traditions, the
                                                    understanding of ʾawliyāʾ also broadened. It began to encompass a
                                                    broader spectrum of mystical, devotional, and ascetic practices and
                                                    beliefs. This expansion and adaptation further cemented the position
                                                    of ʾawliyāʾ within the social and religious fabric of Muslim
                                                    societies.

                                                    interpretation of ʾawliyāʾ diverged substantially across different
                                                    schools of thought. Sunni and Shia interpretations, for instance,
                                                    varied in terms of who could be considered a ‘walī’ and the specific
                                                    roles they could play within the community. While Sunnis generally
                                                    accepted the existence of ʾawliyāʾ, they contested the ability of
                                                    humans to definitively identify them, emphasising that such
                                                    recognition lies solely within God’s knowledge.22 The Shia, on the
                                                    other hand, recognised specific individuals – the Imams, descendants
                                                    of Prophet Muḥammad – as ʾawliyāʾ, attributing to them a central
                                                    role in guiding the community and interpreting Islamic teachings.23

                                                <p>
                                                    The concept of ʾawliyāʾ has also been a significant element within
                                                    various folk and popular
                                                    expressions of Islam, particularly in regions like South Asia, North
                                                    Africa, and the Middle
                                                    East. Here, the tombs and shrines of individuals considered ʾawliyāʾ
                                                    have become focal
                                                    points for local devotional practices. They serve not only as places
                                                    of prayer and reflection

                                                    but also as sites for the celebration of the lives and miracles of
                                                    these revered individuals,
                                                    often through annual festivals or ‘Urs. 24

                                                <p>
                                                    However, these practices have not been without controversy. Within
                                                    the diverse landscape of Islamic thought, there have been voices of
                                                    criticism and dissent, particularly from puritanical movements like
                                                    Wahhabism and Salafism. These groups challenge the legitimacy of
                                                    veneration practices associated with ʾawliyāʾ, viewing them as
                                                    innovations (Bidʿa) that deviate from the true essence of Islam.25
                                                    More recently, the concept has seen further evolution, chiefly
                                                    through the lens of Islamic reform movements and academic critiques.
                                                    Reform movements like Salafism and Wahhabism, aiming to purify Islam
                                                    from perceived innovations, have generally critiqued the veneration
                                                    of ʾawliyāʾ and dismissed the possibility of intercession, pushing
                                                    for a return to the original Qurʾānic concept.26

                                                <p>
                                                    Simultaneously, contemporary academic studies have further expanded
                                                    the understanding of ʾawliyāʾ, studying their role in local
                                                    cultures, rituals, and the socio-political dynamics surrounding
                                                    their veneration. Cornell (1998) noted that “the ʾawliyāʾ serve as
                                                    local cultural heroes and social models, shaping and reflecting the
                                                    needs and aspirations of the communities that venerate them”.27 In
                                                    this sense, the ʾawliyāʾ are not all that different to the concept
                                                    of patron saints in Catholicism.

                                                    Thus, from its early Qurʾānic roots, through the lens of classical
                                                    Sufi thought, and onto the scrutiny of modern Islamic reform
                                                    movements and academia, the concept of ʾawliyāʾ has witnessed a
                                                    significant evolution and expansion. It has transformed from being a
                                                    term denoting divine friendship to a complex spiritual category
                                                    within Islamic practice.

                                                    In sum, the historical evolution of ʾawliyāʾ reflects the diverse
                                                    and dynamic nature of Islamic
                                                    thought and practice. The notion of ʾawliyāʾ occupies a central
                                                    place in Sufism, the Sufi
                                                    understanding of ʾawliyāʾ is inherently connected to their broader
                                                    conceptions of spirituality,
                                                    God’s presence, and the path to divine proximity. In Sufism, the
                                                    ʾawliyāʾ are not only perceived as God’s friends but also as
                                                    spiritual guides, often termed as Shaykhs or Pīrs, who assist others
                                                    in their spiritual journey. The Sufis support this concept with an
                                                    esoteric reading of the Qur’anic verse,

                                                    The Sufi tradition’s spiritual guidance concept, characterised by a
                                                    mentoring relationship between the Shaykh or Pīr and the disciple or
                                                    murīd, bears significant correlations with practices seen in other
                                                    religious traditions, namely Hinduism, Buddhism, and ancient Persian
                                                    religions. While each tradition upholds its unique elements,
                                                    commonalities can be traced in their shared emphasis on a
                                                    mentor-disciple relationship and the pursuit of spiritual growth. It
                                                    is, however, imperative to discern between parallel practices and
                                                    direct influence, the latter being an assertion needing robust
                                                    historical and textual evidence.

                                                    Nonetheless, the potential influences of these other spiritual
                                                    traditions on Sufi concepts of spiritual guidance are worthy of
                                                    exploration. During the Islamic Golden Age (8th to 14th century CE),
                                                    Islamic scholars had notable interaction with Hindu, Buddhist, and
                                                    Persian cultures, a fact that scholars such as Seyyed Hossein Nasr
                                                    argue may have influenced the development of certain Islamic thought
                                                    aspects, including Sufism. 29

                                                <p>
                                                    Hinduism’s influence may be traced in the close-knit bond between
                                                    the Sufi Shaykh and the murīd, a relationship akin to the Hindu
                                                    Guru-Shishya tradition. This bond forms the bedrock for imparting
                                                    spiritual knowledge and guidance on the path of spiritual
                                                    enlightenment. In the ‘Upadeśa Sāhasrī,’ a principal Advaita Vedānta
                                                    work by Śankara, the Guru is depicted as a guide leading the Shishya
                                                    from ignorance to knowledge of the ultimate reality. 30

                                                    Similarly, Buddhism’s influence may be discerned in the focus on
                                                    inward spiritual transformation and purification within Sufi
                                                    teachings, a theme heavily stressed in Buddhism.

                                                    The concept of a spiritual mentor is integral to both, with Buddhist
                                                    texts such as the Dhammapada underscoring the importance of
                                                    spiritual guidance in the path to liberation. 31

                                                    Moreover, ancient Persian religions such as Zoroastrianism were
                                                    prevalent in Persia and Central Asia when Islam began to spread in
                                                    these regions. Zoroastrian priests, known as Dastūrs, had a similar
                                                    role to the Sufi Shaykh, which may have influenced the evolving Sufi
                                                    concept of the spiritual guide.

                                                <p>
                                                    However, while these correlations exist, the fundamental basis of
                                                    Sufism and the concept of spiritual guidance within it is deeply

                                                    Al-Ghazālī, emphasise the need for a spiritual guide for an
                                                    individual’s spiritual journey.33 Thus, while external influences
                                                    may have shaped the Sufi tradition’s specific practices and
                                                    perspectives, the core of Sufi spiritual guidance remains grounded
                                                    in Islamic teachings. AlGhazālī described the ʾawliyāʾ as those who
                                                    have traversed the path of obligatory religious observance and have
                                                    advanced to the levels of supererogatory acts of devotion. He
                                                    writes, “They have been given to drink from the chalice of love and
                                                    have lost their senses; then they have been nurtured on the bed of
                                                    care and longing love”.34 This highlights a profound sense of love
                                                    and devotion to God and the concept of fanāʾ (annihilation of self
                                                    in God) in the state of the ʾawliyāʾ, which Sufis explain with the

                                                    wrote extensively about sainthood in his Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya. He
                                                    delineated the ʾawliyāʾ as individuals in constant communion with
                                                    God, being entirely surrendered to His will. He stated, “God’s
                                                    saints are under His domes; no prophet knows them save a prophet, no

                                                    However, Sufi interpretations of ʾawliyāʾ have not been universally
                                                    accepted within the broader Islamic discourse. Some scholars, like
                                                    Ibn Taymiyya, critiqued the excessive veneration of ʾawliyāʾ and
                                                    cautioned against practices that might infringe on Tawḥīd. 37

                                                    Throughout their writings, Sufis have extolled the spiritual states
                                                    and stations of the ʾawliyāʾ. As described in Sufi writings, the
                                                    metaphysical experiences of the ʾawliyāʾ serve as guidance for
                                                    aspirants on the spiritual path. For instance, ‘Abd al-Qādir
                                                    al-Jīlānī, the eponymous founder of the Qadiriyya order of Sufism,
                                                    characterised ʾawliyāʾ as the inheritors of the Prophets’ spiritual
                                                    knowledge. He believed that the ʾawliyāʾ are those who have realised
                                                    the Oneness of God not merely in intellectual terms but as a lived
                                                    reality, stating, “The ‘walī’ is he who is with the Truth in every
                                                    state”.38

                                                    Rūmī, the celebrated Persian Sufi poet, elaborates further on the
                                                    ʾawliyāʾ’s nature. Rūmī’s writings underscore the understanding of
                                                    ʾawliyāʾ as individuals immersed in divine love and ecstasy. He
                                                    writes, “The ʾawliyāʾ are those who have died before death and whose
                                                    lives are with their Lord”.39

                                                <p>
                                                    The concept of ʾawliyāʾ in Sufism is thus closely tied with its
                                                    esoteric traditions of spiritual
                                                    mentorship and discipleship, inner purification, and the aspirant’s
                                                    journey towards God realisation. However, it must be noted that
                                                    these interpretations are specific to Sufi philosophy and are not
                                                    universally accepted across all Islamic sects or interpretations.
                                                    Understanding these perspectives within the broader spectrum of
                                                    Islamic thought, and the specific context of Sufi mysticism is
                                                    crucial.

                                                    The interpretation of ʾawliyāʾ has evolved over time. Comparing and
                                                    contrasting Sufi interpretations with the earlier usage provides a
                                                    rich insight into the diversity of thought within Islam. The
                                                    Qurʾānic understanding of ʾawliyāʾ, as established in the nascent
                                                    period of Islamic civilisation, primarily represented the allies or
                                                    friends of Allāh, distinguished by their faith and piety. Early
                                                    interpretations, as seen in the ḥadīth literature and works of
                                                    classical scholars such as al-Ghazālī and Ibn Taymiyya, further
                                                    enhanced this understanding. These foundational interpretations
                                                    focus on the ʾawliyāʾ’s religious observance, moral righteousness,
                                                    and a distinct relationship with the divine, anchored in both
                                                    adherence to religious duties and the pursuit of additional
                                                    devotional acts.40

                                                <p>
                                                    In contrast, Sufi interpretations have expanded on these concepts,
                                                    bringing a more esoteric and mystical dimension to the understanding
                                                    of ʾawliyāʾ. Sufi scholars, such as ‘Abd al-Qādir al-Jīlānī and
                                                    Rūmī, have emphasised the ʾawliyāʾ’s transformative spiritual
                                                    experiences, inner purification, and realisation of divine unity.41
                                                    The ʾawliyāʾ, in Sufi understanding, transcend conventional
                                                    religious practice, achieving a state of constant divine remembrance
                                                    and existential unity with the divine.

                                                    However, these Sufi interpretations do not entirely diverge from the
                                                    foundational understanding. Rather, they build upon the earlier
                                                    interpretations, adding layers of mystical insight. Moral
                                                    righteousness, observance of religious duties, and the desire for
                                                    proximity to God remain consistent elements across both the earlier
                                                    and later interpretations.

                                                    the divine has occasionally been a source of contention, with some
                                                    scholars cautioning against potential deviations from monotheistic
                                                    principles or the deification of individuals as ʾawliyāʾ.

                                                    spiritual insights, it also underlines the need for balanced

                                                    and contemporary examples, providing a richer and tangible
                                                    understanding of the concept.

                                                    One prominent example is that of Rābiʿa al-ʿAdawiyya (717-801), a
                                                    renowned female Sufi saint from Basra. Her life, as recorded in
                                                    Farīd ad-Dīn ʿAṭṭār’s “Tadhkirat al-ʾAwliyāʾ” (The Memorial of the
                                                    Saints), is a testament to the Sufi understanding of ʾawliyāʾ. 42
                                                    Rābiʿa was noted for her absolute devotion and love for God, which
                                                    was unattached to the fear of hell or the desire for paradise. Her
                                                    famous prayer, “If I worship You for fear of Hell, burn me in Hell,
                                                    and if I worship You in hope of Paradise, exclude me from Paradise.
                                                    But if I worship You for Your Own sake, grudge me not Your
                                                    everlasting Beauty,” reflects the profound spiritual state of an
                                                    ʾawliyāʾ in Sufi tradition.43 Another case is that of Al-Junayd of
                                                    Baghdad (830-910), a key figure in developing the Sufi school of
                                                    thought. His teachings underscored the significance of “fanāʾ”
                                                    (annihilation of the self in God) and “baqāʾ” (subsistence with
                                                    God), foundational concepts within Sufism.44 His life and teachings
                                                    demonstrate the transformative journey of an ʾawliyāʾ from
                                                    self-effacement to a state of divine consciousness. The story of
                                                    Mansur Al-Hallaj (858-922), documented by Louis Massignon in “The
                                                    Passion of Al-Hallaj,” offers a compelling example of the mystical
                                                    dimensions of Sufi ʾawliyāʾ. 45 Al-Hallaj’s infamous declaration,
                                                    “Ana’l-Ḥaqq” (I am the Truth), represented the ultimate stage of
                                                    “fanāʾ”, a state of oneness with the divine. This claim, while
                                                    controversial and leading to his execution, is often cited as an
                                                    illustration of the intense spiritual experiences of Sufi ʾawliyāʾ.
                                                    The contemporary example of Bāba Yārā (1920-1969), a Sufi saint from
                                                    Afghanistan, elucidates the continuation of these concepts in modern
                                                    times. Recorded in the ethnographic study by David Edwards, “Heroes
                                                    of the Age,” Bāba Yārā was revered for his ascetic lifestyle,
                                                    spiritual insight, and the miracles attributed to him. His life
                                                    manifests the enduring relevance of the Sufi concept of ʾawliyāʾ. 46

                                                    The concept of ʾawliyāʾ, while rooted in the foundational texts and
                                                    classical interpretations of Islam, continues to influence
                                                    contemporary Islamic rituals and practices significantly. This
                                                    influence is seen across a wide range of activities, from daily
                                                    personal piety to communal religious observances.

                                                    One of the critical areas of influence is in the realm of personal
                                                    devotion and spiritual practices. For many Muslims, the lives of the
                                                    ʾawliyāʾ, as recorded in hagiographies and traditional accounts,
                                                    serve as spiritual templates.47 These narratives often detail the
                                                    piety, devotion, asceticism, and moral conduct of the ʾawliyāʾ,
                                                    providing models for individuals seeking to deepen their own
                                                    spiritual journey. Many Muslims undertake practices such as dhikr
                                                    (remembrance of God), fasting, night prayers, and other forms of
                                                    worship inspired by the examples of the ʾawliyāʾ.

                                                    The influence of the ʾawliyāʾ is also seen in the practice of
                                                    visiting tombs and shrines of revered individuals, a tradition
                                                    common in many parts of the Islamic world. These visits, often
                                                    associated with seeking blessings (baraka) and intercession
                                                    (tawassul), are inspired by the belief in the ʾawliyāʾ’s spiritual
                                                    status even after their physical demise.48 While these practices are
                                                    contentious, their prevalence underscores the enduring impact of the
                                                    concept of ʾawliyāʾ.

                                                    continue to be celebrated through mawlids (birth anniversaries) and
                                                    ‘urs (death anniversaries). These occasions often involve reciting
                                                    the lives and miracles of the ʾawliyāʾ, devotional music and poetry,
                                                    communal prayers, and sharing of meals.49

                                                    In the realm of spirituality and mysticism, the ʾawliyāʾ’s teachings
                                                    continue to guide the
                                                    practices and teachings of various Sufi orders (tariqas). These
                                                    include spiritual exercises, ethical instructions, and modes of
                                                    discipleship that shape the spiritual life of countless Muslims
                                                    worldwide. 50

                                                    One of the most widely recognised practices is the veneration of
                                                    shrines and tombs of the ʾawliyāʾ, often known as Ziyāra. This
                                                    ritual involves visiting the resting places of these revered figures
                                                    as a form of spiritual pilgrimage. Believers engage in prayers,
                                                    recitation of the Qur’an, and supplications, seeking spiritual
                                                    blessings (baraka) from these individuals who are perceived as God’s
                                                    close friends.51 Notable examples include the shrine of Abdul Qadir
                                                    Jilani in Baghdad, the tomb of Rūmī in Konya, and the Mausoleum of
                                                    Shaykh Zaynudin in Tashkent.

                                                    These include intensified practices of prayer, fasting, and night
                                                    vigils drawn from stories about the ʾawliyāʾ’s piety and
                                                    asceticism.52 There are also specific forms of dhikr (remembrance of
                                                    God) associated with ʾawliyāʾ that continue to be practised.

                                                    In the realm of Sufism, the influence of the ʾawliyāʾ is
                                                    particularly pronounced. Sufi orders (tariqas) often trace their
                                                    spiritual lineage (Silsila) to renowned ʾawliyāʾ and base their
                                                    teachings and practices on their spiritual insights. Examples
                                                    include the Qadiriyya order, which traces its lineage to Abdul Qadir
                                                    Jilani, and the Mevlevi order, founded by the followers of Rūmī. 53

                                                    The concept of ʾawliyāʾ, while having significant spiritual value
                                                    and influence within certain
                                                    Islamic traditions, has not escaped academic scrutiny and criticism.
                                                    These debates largely
                                                    revolve around the interpretation of Qur’anic texts, the roles and
                                                    status of ʾawliyāʾ, and their
                                                    associated practices. Interpretation of Qur’anic texts is one of the
                                                    focal points of academic
                                                    debate. Some scholars argue that the term ʾAwliyāʾ in the Qurʾān
                                                    refers broadly to all devout
                                                    and righteous believers rather than a particular category of saintly
                                                    individuals.54 They argue that saint veneration risks creating a
                                                    class of intercessors, which could compromise monotheism and direct
                                                    communication with God.55

                                                    contentious. Critics argue that the elevated status accorded to the
                                                    ʾawliyāʾ in some traditions can lead to a personality cult,
                                                    detracting from the worship of God.56 They posit that the
                                                    extraordinary powers or miracles (karāmāt) attributed to the
                                                    ʾawliyāʾ are often based on weak or fabricated ḥadith and can foster
                                                    superstition and magical thinking.57

                                                    The practices associated with ʾawliyāʾ, such as the veneration of
                                                    tombs, shrines, and relics, are also a major area of debate.
                                                    Scholars like Ibn Taymiyya famously critiqued these practices,
                                                    arguing that they could lead to shirk. 58

                                                    The role of ʾawliyāʾ has been a subject of ongoing debate and
                                                    controversy, with various perspectives put forward by scholars and
                                                    practitioners alike. The controversies surrounding the role of
                                                    ʾawliyāʾ are complex and multifaceted, reflecting broader debates
                                                    within the Muslim world about religious practice, authenticity, and
                                                    authority. The Sufi understanding of ʾawliyāʾ presents an enriched
                                                    tapestry of spiritual intimacy with the Divine, granting the
                                                    ʾawliyāʾ a unique station in the religious and societal landscape.
                                                    However, this elevated status and the subsequent practices
                                                    associated with the ʾawliyāʾ have often been at the centre of
                                                    discussions on bidʿa.

                                                    The veneration of the ʾawliyāʾ, has often been associated with
                                                    bidʿa. This is particularly the case with certain practices such as
                                                    visiting of shrines (Ziyāra), seeking intercession (tawassul)
                                                    through the ʾawliyāʾ. 59

                                                <p>
                                                    For instance, the act of Ziyāra or visiting the shrines of ʾawliyāʾ
                                                    is not prescribed in the
                                                    Qurʾān or Ḥadīth. Critics argue that this practice diverts from
                                                    monotheistic worship towards
                                                    a form of saint veneration.60 Similarly, the practice of tawassul,
                                                    or seeking intercession through the ʾawliyāʾ is a gross innovation,
                                                    as intercession should be sought directly from God.61

                                                    Furthermore, the Sufi understanding of ʾawliyāʾ often entails a
                                                    profound respect for these spiritually enlightened individuals who
                                                    have achieved a deep, intimate connection with God.62 The Qasidas
                                                    (poems) and Nashīds (songs) dedicated to the ʾawliyāʾ often contain
                                                    lavish praise and admiration, expressing the spiritual
                                                    accomplishments and virtues of these individuals. The ʾawliyāʾ are
                                                    frequently attributed to having unparalleled wisdom, deep insight,
                                                    and a powerful connection with the Divine that transcends the
                                                    ordinary. Some examples include the praise filled Qasidas dedicated
                                                    to figures like Shaykh ‘Abdul Qadir Jilani or Moinuddin Chishti,
                                                    where they are revered as grand spiritual authorities.63 However,
                                                    such an over-exaggeration blurs the lines between veneration and
                                                    worship; this excessive praise could unintentionally lead to a form
                                                    of shirk, even if this is not the intention of the individuals
                                                    expressing the praise.64

                                                <p>
                                                    Beyond shirk, other risks are associated with the over-exaggeration
                                                    of ʾawliyāʾ within the Sufi tradition. There have been unfortunate
                                                    instances where individuals claiming to be ʾawliyāʾ have subjected
                                                    followers to psychological and physical abuses. The power dynamic
                                                    inherent in the relationship between a spiritual guide and a
                                                    disciple can sometimes create a conducive environment for abuse. The
                                                    guide’s authority, if unchecked, can lead to harmful behaviours
                                                    being justified under the guise of spiritual instruction or
                                                    development. This is not unique to Sufism but is a risk inherent in
                                                    any structure where individuals influence others significantly. 65

                                                    For instance, there have been cases where supposed ʾawliyāʾ have
                                                    manipulated followers emotionally and psychologically under the
                                                    pretence of guiding them on their spiritual journey. This
                                                    manipulation can lead to followers feeling trapped, confused, and
                                                    distressed, believing that resistance or questioning may equate to
                                                    spiritual failure.66 Physically, there have been reports of leaders
                                                    causing harm to their disciples, rationalising this as a form of
                                                    ‘spiritual training’ or ‘cleansing’. These incidents can involve
                                                    physical punishments or imposing extreme practices that put
                                                    individuals’ health and well-being at risk.67

                                                    context is that of Shaykh Nuh Keller’s group. Keller, a renowned
                                                    Sufi Shaykh, has been accused of emotionally manipulating his
                                                    followers, leading to negative psychological impacts. Critics of the
                                                    group claim that individuals who raise questions about the Shaykh’s
                                                    teaching are labelled ‘arrogant’ and made to feel spiritually
                                                    inferior, leading to feelings of guilt, fear, and spiritual
                                                    inadequacy.68 This control and manipulation can have profound

                                                    ‘walī’ known as Ahmet Mahmut Ünlü, also known as ‘Cübbeli Ahmet

                                                    College, London,
                                                    revealed that followers of certain Sufi orders have experienced a
                                                    form of abuse termed
                                                    ‘spiritual abuse’. This involves the manipulation of a person’s
                                                    spirituality by an individual in a position of spiritual authority,
                                                    such as an ʾawliyāʾ, to gain power and control over them.71
                                                    Spiritual abuse can involve emotional abuse, social isolation, and

                                                    found in the case of Shaykh Fethullah Gülen’s group, the Gülen
                                                    movement. Followers of Gülen regard him as a spiritual guide and are
                                                    said to show an excessive devotion to him, to the point that it
                                                    takes on cult-like behaviours.72 Former members of the group have
                                                    reported being subjected to brainwashing techniques and have spoken
                                                    about the psychological toll that leaving the group took on them.73

                                                    Nazim, reveals another dark side of misused authority. While Shaykh
                                                    Nazim himself was a widely respected Sufi leader, some leaders

                                                    followers. Allegations range from excessive demands for monetary
                                                    donations to fraud and extortion.74 This manipulation and
                                                    exploitation betray the trust and spiritual commitment of the
                                                    followers, causing emotional and financial hardship.

                                                    Sexual abuse is another severe form of misuse that has been
                                                    reported. The spiritual authority vested in ʾawliyāʾ can create
                                                    power dynamics that may be exploited to commit such abuses. An
                                                    example of this is the case involving the leader of a Sufi order in
                                                    North Africa who was convicted for sexual assault and human
                                                    trafficking.75 The leader used his position of spiritual influence
                                                    to manipulate and sexually exploit his followers, a gross violation

                                                    The Sufi order of Tijaniyyah, prominent in West Africa, was
                                                    embroiled in a scandal when it was reported that certain individuals
                                                    within the order were exploiting the concept of “khalwah” or
                                                    spiritual seclusion. Instead of the practice serving as a period for
                                                    spiritual reflection and connection with the divine, it was alleged
                                                    that some ʾawliyāʾ were manipulating the concept to isolate and

                                                    These examples shed light on the potential for gross misuse of the
                                                    concept of ʾawliyāʾ and the hazards it can pose

                                                    The interpretation of the concept of ʾawliyāʾ within Sufism is
                                                    dynamic, varying across different Sufi orders, cultures, and
                                                    historical contexts. While the mainstream understanding, derived
                                                    from Qurʾānic and ḥadīth sources, denotes the ʾawliyāʾ as righteous
                                                    and pious Muslims close to God, certain instances contradict this
                                                    normative view. A notable example of this is the recognition of
                                                    non-Muslim individuals, particularly within Hindu communities, as
                                                    Sufi saints or ʾawliyāʾ.

                                                    A prime illustration is found within the Naqshbandi order, which has
                                                    a substantial presence in
                                                    South Asia, where Islam and Hinduism have coexisted for centuries.78
                                                    Certain branches of the
                                                    Naqshbandi order have recognised Hindu individuals as Shaykhs, or
                                                    spiritual guides. This has
                                                    stemmed from a broader understanding of spirituality that transcends
                                                    the bounds of religious identity. In such instances, the emphasis is
                                                    on universal spiritual values and mystical experiences rather than
                                                    adherence to a specific religious creed.79

                                                    This phenomenon is not without controversy, as it challenges the
                                                    traditional Islamic understanding of ʾawliyāʾ. The Qurʾān states,
                                                    “Behold, the ʾawliyāʾ of Allāh – there will be “…no fear concerning
                                                    them, nor will they grieve”.80 Classical Islamic scholars such as
                                                    alQurṭubī have interpreted this verse to mean that the ʾawliyāʾ are
                                                    devout Muslims who have true faith and perform righteous deeds.81

                                                <p>
                                                    From this perspective, recognising non-Muslims as ʾawliyāʾ
                                                    contradicts the Qurʾānic definition and creates a theological
                                                    conundrum. It raises questions about the boundaries of religious
                                                    identity and the parameters of spiritual authority within Islam.

                                                    It is worth noting, however, that Sufism has often been
                                                    characterised by a spirit of inclusivity and an appreciation for the
                                                    shared mystical experiences found across different religious
                                                    traditions. Some Sufi scholars have advocated for an understanding
                                                    of ʾawliyāʾ that recognises the possibility of non-Muslims
                                                    possessing spiritual insight and wisdom.82

                                                <p>
                                                    However, such interpretations have faced intense criticism from
                                                    those who argue that this broad interpretation dilutes the distinct
                                                    Islamic character of the concept of ʾawliyāʾ and deviates from
                                                    normative Islamic teachings. It has ignited debates on the nature of
                                                    religious authority, inclusivity, and the interpretation of Islamic
                                                    concepts. The inclusion of nonMuslims into the status of ʾawliyāʾ
                                                    by Sufis begs the question of what value does this status have?

                                                    The greatest risk associated with the Sufi notion of ʾawliyāʾ is
                                                    Shirk. In Sufi traditions,
                                                    ʾawliyāʾ are often believed to possess karāmāt, and their
                                                    intercession is sought in
                                                    supplications. This has led to practices such as visiting tombs of
                                                    ʾawliyāʾ (Ziyāra), venerating their relics, and attributing
                                                    supernatural powers to them.83 Such traditions attribute partners to
                                                    God by assigning to ʾawliyāʾ divine-like powers and capacities,
                                                    which contravenes tawḥīd.

                                                    Classical Sufi scholars like Ibn ʿArabī argued that there’s a clear
                                                    distinction between the essence of God and the actions of God. While
                                                    the essence of God is unique and exclusive, His actions, such as
                                                    providing sustenance or answering prayers, can manifest through His
                                                    creation. As such, the ʾawliyāʾ, being close to God, could be the
                                                    means through which God’s actions are manifested without infringing
                                                    upon His uniqueness.84

                                                    However, this nuanced understanding may not always be maintained in
                                                    popular practices. The elevation of ʾawliyāʾ to saintly status, the
                                                    attribution of extraordinary miracles to them, and the excessive
                                                    devotion directed towards them could potentially slide into shirk if
                                                    not properly understood and monitored.

                                                    Intercession sought through the ʾawliyāʾ finds its genesis in a
                                                    perhaps misconstrued comprehension of their divine proximity and
                                                    spiritual eminence. Al-Ghazālī’s monumental creation, Iḥyā ʾulūm
                                                    al-Dīn, expounds on the spiritual hierarchy, portraying the ʾawliyāʾ
                                                    as beings in the higher echelons of divine proximity. The homage to
                                                    the ʾawliyāʾ is not an innovation. As pointed out by Al-Majlisi,
                                                    instances of such deference can be traced to the nascent stages of
                                                    Islam. 85 The deviation arises when adulation crosses the limits of
                                                    homage and enters the domain of worship, inadvertently culminating
                                                    in Shirk.

                                                <p>
                                                    Ibn Taymiyya sternly cautions against this practice, deeming it a
                                                    major form of Shirk. The intentions and comprehension behind
                                                    intercession dictate whether it is permissible or not, as emphasised
                                                    by Ibn Taymiyya in Kitāb al-Īmān. However, societal customs and
                                                    traditions often overshadow the meticulous equilibrium advocated by
                                                    scholars. The implications of Shirk are grave. As articulated by
                                                    Al-Ghazālī in Iḥyā ʾulūm al-Dīn, the penalty for Shirk is unending
                                                    damnation. Yet, he also reaffirms that Allāh’s mercy encompasses
                                                    all, and repentance is accepted by those who commit shirk out of
                                                    ignorance if they refrain once they comprehend their mistake. The
                                                    Qurʾān sternly warns against idolising others alongside Allāh,

                                                    This verse warns against seeking intercession from any besides
                                                    Allāh, a form of Shirk. The ʾawliyāʾ, irrespective of their
                                                    devoutness, cannot override divine sovereignty or claim His
                                                    exclusive rights. In a ḥadīth qudsi, Allāh says, “I am so
                                                    self-sufficient that I do not need an associate. Thus, he who does
                                                    an action for someone else’s sake, as well as Mine, will have that
                                                    action renounced by Me to him whom he associated with Me”.87 In this
                                                    line of discourse, we can infer that the veneration of ʾawliyāʾ
                                                    holds the potential danger of leading into the territory of Shirk if
                                                    not carefully managed. This concern can especially come into play
                                                    when an individual’s status or proximity to the Divine is raised to
                                                    such an extent that it eclipses the exclusive dominion of Allāh. The
                                                    ʾawliyāʾ, despite their perceived spiritual ascension, remain
                                                    creatures of Allāh, bound to His command, and not co-equal partners
                                                    in His divine reign.

                                                    Thus, while the ʾawliyāʾ are highly esteemed within the Sufi
                                                    tradition, and their close relationship with Allāh is recognised and
                                                    respected, their veneration should never reach the point where it
                                                    challenges or dilutes the monotheistic essence of Islam. Any such
                                                    approach could potentially lead to the grave sin of Shirk, as it
                                                    distorts the clear delineation between the Creator and the created.

                                                    Moreover, a well-known Ḥadīth serves as a clear warning against the
                                                    dangers of Shirk: “Avoid the seven deadly sins.” The people
                                                    enquired, ‘O Messenger of Allāh, what are they?’ He replied,
                                                    “Associating anything with Allāh…”. 88 This Ḥadīth again accentuates
                                                    the importance of strictly upholding Tawḥīd and not associating any
                                                    partners with Allāh.

                                                    In conclusion, the Sufi understanding of ʾawliyāʾ, while it embodies
                                                    a profound spiritual dimension of Islam, must be navigated with
                                                    caution to prevent any accidental drift towards the boundaries of
                                                    Shirk. It is a delicate journey, and the boundaries must be
                                                    well-respected to ensure that one’s devotion and love for the
                                                    ʾawliyāʾ do not infringe upon the undivided divinity and sovereignty
                                                    of Allāh.

                                                    Fundamentally, the Qurʾān promotes the direct connection between the
                                                    worshipper and Allāh, discouraging reliance on intercession. A

                                                    readiness to answer their supplications. These Qurʾānic references
                                                    reinforce that Allāh alone is the sovereign, omniscient entity
                                                    capable of granting all requests. Thus, approaching Allāh directly
                                                    without intermediaries is sufficient and encouraged by Allāh.

                                                    This verse clearly states that we are only in need of Allāh, no
                                                    intermediary can aid us or protect us, rather, we should turn to
                                                    Allāh alone. Moreover, numerous ḥadīth elucidate the permissibility
                                                    of direct supplication to Allāh. In one such tradition narrated by
                                                    Anas ibn Mālik, Prophet Muḥammad is reported to have said: “When one
                                                    of you makes a supplication, he should supplicate with a will and
                                                    should not say, ‘O Allāh, confer upon me if You like,’ for there is
                                                    none who can compel Allāh to do something against His Will”.92 This
                                                    ḥadīth reaffirms the direct relationship between the believer and
                                                    Allāh in the context of supplication.

                                                    more, the notion of Tawassul is often misunderstood. As elucidated
                                                    by Shaykh alIslām Ibn Taymiyya in his ‘Majmūʿ al-Fatāwā’, one’s
                                                    Tawassul should be through Allāh’s names, attributes, or righteous
                                                    deeds, rather than relying on other beings, including ʾawliyāʾ.

                                                    In conclusion, the theological discourse within Islam firmly
                                                    establishes the permissibility and, indeed, the recommendation of
                                                    directly supplicating to Allāh without seeking intercession through
                                                    ʾawliyāʾ. This direct line of communication upholds Tawḥīd,
                                                    preserving the exclusivity of Allāh’s authority and ensuring that
                                                    one’s faith remains free from any potential forms of Shirk

                                                    The Qurʾān articulates this sentiment in numerous verses. One of the

                                                    capable of satisfying all their needs. Furthermore, ḥadīth
                                                    literature affirms this belief. A narration by ʿUmar ibn alKhaṭṭāb
                                                    narrates the Prophet Muḥammad as saying, “If you all rely on Allāh
                                                    with due reliance, He would certainly give you provision as He gives
                                                    it to birds who go forth hungry in the morning and return with a
                                                    full belly at dusk”.95 This ḥadīth illustrates the concept of
                                                    Tawakkul and affirms Allāh as the Provider and Sustainer.

                                                <p>
                                                    However, the reliance on Allāh does not negate the need for human
                                                    effort. Islamic teachings emphasise the balance between trust in
                                                    divine providence and the necessity of human endeavour. As evidenced
                                                    in the ḥadīth narrated by Anas ibn Mālik, “The Prophet Muḥammad
                                                    said, ‘Trust in Allāh but tie your camel'”.96 This metaphor
                                                    highlights the balance between trust in Allāh and personal
                                                    responsibility.

                                                    emotional, and psychological needs. The Qurʾān teaches that
                                                    remembrance of Allāh (Dhikr) brings tranquillity to hearts,

                                                    Therefore, from both the Qurʾānic and ḥadīth perspectives, as well
                                                    as the interpretations of esteemed Islamic scholars, the faith
                                                    unequivocally establishes the sufficiency of Allāh in fulfilling all
                                                    the needs of a believer. It encourages absolute trust in Allāh,
                                                    implying that no entity, however, revered, can provide what only
                                                    Allāh can. Allāh is sufficient for all needs, and believers should
                                                    place their trust in Him. In conclusion, the concept of a Walī has
                                                    evolved throughout Islamic history; the early ascetics were Muslims
                                                    of the utmost piety, true paragons of the Qurʾān and Sunna. However,
                                                    as external sources influenced Muslims, Sufism developed a unique
                                                    metaphysics and esoteric readings of the Qurʾān which turned the
                                                    walī into a saint with unique insights into deep esoteric knowledge
                                                    and hidden truths, capable of performing feats beyond that of a
                                                    normal Muslim without this knowledge. As such, we can see that the
                                                    term ʾawliyāʾ has deviated from the intended meaning in Qurʾān. The
                                                    true ʾawliyāʾ are Muslims who adhere to the Qurʾān and Sunna, avoid
                                                    sins and seek closeness with Allāh alone. These are individuals who
                                                    manifest tawhid into their lives, encompass the Sharīʿa and serve
                                                    Allāh. This does not require a guide or membership to a Sufi order.
                                                    Instead, it requires reliance and obedience, worship of Allāh alone.
                                                    The true ʾawliyāʾ call on Allāh alone and invite others to do the

                                                The concept of ʾawliyāʾ, poetically translated as “friends of Allah,” resonates with profound spiritual depth within the Islamic fabric. This term goes beyond surface-level understanding, as it encapsulates individuals who have cultivated a unique, heartfelt closeness and camaraderie with the Divine.
                                            </div>
                                            <div>
Originating from the Arabic root w-l-y, denoting intimacy and companionship, ʾawliyāʾ unveils layers of spiritual profundity. The word “walī” in Arabic gracefully extends its meanings to not just a friend, but also a guardian, protector, and unwavering supporter. It frequently refers to the revered Islamic saints, perceived as the true confidants of Allah. These individuals are celebrated for their exceptional devotion, piety, and an elevated consciousness of Allah, navigating the journey of life with unwavering faith.
</div>
<div>
The Qurʾān, Islam’s sacred text, eloquently speaks to the essence of ʾawliyāʾ, providing divine assurance to those aligned with Allah: “Behold! Verily, no fear shall be upon the friends of Allah, nor shall they grieve.” (Qur’an 10:62). This scriptural gem underscores the spiritual liberation and serenity promised to the ʾawliyāʾ, affirming their blessed state in both this life and the hereafter. 
</div>
<div>
Historically, the interpretation of ʾawliyāʾ has been enriched and diversified through various intellectual lenses. Al-Ghazālī, a luminary in Islamic thought, saw them as spiritual virtuosos transcending conventional religious practices, immersing themselves in divine love. Contrarily, Ibn Taymiyya emphasized staunch piety and adherence to the Sharīʿa, highlighting a life anchored in divine law over miraculous feats.
</div>
<div>
Sufi mystics, like Ibn Arabi and Rūmī, painted the ʾawliyāʾ as divine conduits of love and guidance, illuminating the spiritual path for seekers. Their resting places transformed into sanctuaries of reverence and spiritual intercession, connecting the earthly realm with the divine. Their enduring legacy continues to inspire and nurture souls on the quest for spiritual enlightenment.
</div>
<div>
Yet, the veneration of ʾawliyāʾ has sparked debates and divergences within the Islamic community. Movements such as Wahhabism and Salafism voice concerns over practices they deem as divergences from Islamic orthodoxy. Simultaneously, academic discourse broadens our perception of ʾawliyāʾ, recognizing their influence as cultural beacons and role models.
</div>
<div>
A pivotal debate hinges on inclusivity—can non-Muslims be recognized as ʾawliyāʾ based on shared spiritual virtues? This question challenges conventional Islamic viewpoints and necessitates a nuanced dialogue rooted in compassion and understanding.
</div>
<div>
The reverence of ʾawliyāʾ, while ingrained in Sufi tradition, necessitates mindful engagement. Striking a balance between veneration and worship is paramount, ensuring we do not compromise the Islamic tenet of tawḥīd, the absolute oneness of God. This delicate dance requires vigilance against potential misuse and abuse, safeguarding the integrity of the spiritual journey.
</div>
<div>
In navigating these spiritual terrains, we anchor our beliefs in the Qurʾān and Sunna, drawing from the divine wellspring of wisdom. The Qurʾān invites us to forge a direct connection with Allah, fostering a relationship of trust and surrender. In the essence of ʾawliyāʾ, we find a call to embody divine unity, live by divine law, and engage in sincere worship, transcending the need for intermediaries.
</div>
<div>
In essence, the ʾawliyāʾ embody a spiritual kinship with Allah, achieved through devotion, piety, and conscious living. As we explore and venerate this sacred concept, let us do so with discernment and fidelity to the teachings of Islam, ensuring our spiritual pursuits remain anchored in divine love and authenticity.
