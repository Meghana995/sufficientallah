                                                    The Qurʾān serves as the ultimate testament of God’s will,
                                                    communicated through revelations
                                                    to the Prophet Muḥammad by the angel Jibrīl over approximately 23
                                                    years in the 7th century
                                                    CE (Neuwirth 2013, 45). This text is often called the Qurʾān, but it
                                                    is not its actual name.
                                                    Qurʾān is a verbal noun (maṣdar) of the Arabic verb qaraʼa (قرأ),
                                                    meaning ‘he read’ or ‘he
                                                    recited’. This is parallel to the original name of the Hebrew Bible,
                                                    ‘Mīqrāʾ’ א ָר ְק ִמ, meaning
                                                    recital, which Jewish biblical scholars use. At the same time, the
                                                    secular term for the Hebrew
                                                    .תָ נָ״ְך ‘Tanakh ‘is Bible
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    The Qurʾān itself had not named itself and was simply a
                                                    self-referential as “the recital”, which, as mentioned above,
                                                    follows from the Abrahamic tradition. The Prophet’s companions
                                                    decided to refer to the Qurʾān as the ‘Muṣḥaf’, meaning a
                                                    compilation of Scripture, which refers to the written copy; however,
                                                    the text itself does not have a specific name and shares the title
                                                    the Recitation as did the previous revelations of God. The Qurʾān
                                                    presents itself as a continuation of God’s revelation to humanity
                                                    and is the final revelation confirming what came before it and
                                                    clarifying the alterations of previous scriptures. This divine
                                                    communication, a series of revelations in the Quraishi dialect of
                                                    the Arabic language, is enshrined in the Qurʾān, which is the
                                                    unaltered word of God. The complexity, depth, and literary grandeur
                                                    of the Qurʾān have cemented its status not merely as a religious
                                                    document but as a profound piece of Arabic literature (Rippin 2001,
                                                    34). A defining attribute of the Qurʾān is its self-awareness and
                                                    divine protection, as illustrated in these verses:

                                                    The Qurʾān holds unique designations that underscore its divine
                                                    nature and function. The title of the Qurʾān, the ‘Furqān’, carries
                                                    significant connotations that are integral to understanding the
                                                    Qurʾān’s purpose. ‘Furqān’ is associated with the Qurʾān, appearing
                                                    eight times. Derived from the Arabic root ‘farq’, which denotes ‘to
                                                    separate’ or ‘to distinguish’, the Furqān is a criterion for
                                                    discerning truth from falsehood (Abdel Haleem 2004, 36). This
                                                    concept is encapsulated in the verse,

                                                    In this context, the Qurʾān as Furqān is perceived as a guide that
                                                    allows believers to differentiate between moral and immoral, just
                                                    and unjust, and ultimately, belief and disbelief. The Qurʾān’s
                                                    function as a Furqān implies a profound connection with preceding
                                                    Abrahamic scriptures. Much like the Torah, which is also described

                                                    “Remember when We gave Moses the Scripture, and the means to
                                                    distinguish [right and wrong], so that you might be guided” (Q.

                                                <p>
                                                    The Qurʾān takes up the mantle of distinguishing right from wrong,
                                                    echoing the legacy of divine guidance provided by the earlier
                                                    scriptures. However, the Qurʾān as the final revelation also holds a
                                                    corrective and confirmative function, acting as the ultimate
                                                    criterion for faith and conduct (Lawrence 2006, 99). The concepts of
                                                    the Furqān intersect in the Qurʾān’s role as a guide for exemplary
                                                    behaviour, etiquette, and morals. As stated in the Qurʾān,

                                                    (Ḥarf, sing. Ḥarf) to facilitate the early Muslim community’s
                                                    understanding and memorisation of the Qurʾān (Melchert 2008, 63).
                                                    The concept of the ‘Aḥruf’ is embedded within a broader framework of
                                                    theology concerning the Qurʾānic revelation and preservation. It is
                                                    sourced from several prophetic traditions (‘Ḥadīth’), the most
                                                    famous of which, narrated by Ibn ʿAbbās, states, “The Qurʾān was
                                                    revealed in seven Aḥruf” (Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī, 4991). In another, Umar
                                                    ibn al-Khattab reported: I heard Hisham ibn Hakim reciting the Sura
                                                    al-Furqān in a way different from how I recited it and how it was
                                                    taught to me by the Messenger of Allah. I was about to argue with
                                                    him, but then I waited until he finished, tied his shirt around his
                                                    neck, and took him to the Prophet. I said, “Indeed, I heard this man
                                                    recite in a way different from what you taught me!” The Prophet said
                                                    to me, “Bring him to me.” Then, Prophet said to him, “Recite.” He
                                                    recited, and the Prophet said, “As it has been revealed.” Then, the
                                                    Prophet said to me, “Recite.” I recited, and the Prophet said, “As
                                                    it has been revealed. Verily, the Quran has been revealed in seven
                                                    dialects. Recite whichever of them you find easy” (Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī
                                                    2287, Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim 818).

                                                    Although scholars have a divergence of opinion regarding the precise
                                                    definition of ‘Aḥruf’, the predominant view posits that they
                                                    represent varying dialects, expressions, or wordings of the Qurʾān
                                                    (Burton 1977, 81). This allowed the Qurʾān to be accessible to the
                                                    Arab tribes,

                                                    each with unique dialect and linguistic nuances. The use of multiple
                                                    wordings exemplifies the inherent flexibility in the Qurʾānic
                                                    revelation, geared towards accommodating the linguistic diversity of
                                                    the early Muslim community. As the Qurʾān states,

                                                    The delivery of the Qurʾān in multiple Aḥruf aligns with this
                                                    overarching principle of making divine guidance comprehensible and
                                                    accessible. Furthermore, using multiple wordings served an inclusive
                                                    purpose, bridging the gap between Arab tribes. By incorporating
                                                    dialectical variations, the Qurʾān established itself as a text for
                                                    all Arabs, regardless of their tribal affiliations or linguistic
                                                    idiosyncrasies. In this way, the Qurʾān’s delivery promoted social
                                                    cohesion and unity among a previously divided populace, reflecting
                                                    the broader social transformation under the banner of Islam (Sells
                                                    1999, 48).

                                                <p>
                                                    These multiple wordings were not divergent in meaning or content;
                                                    they maintained the same message with slight linguistic variations.
                                                    The integrity of the Qurʾān’s content across the Aḥruf was ensured
                                                    by the meticulous process of revelation, where the Prophet Muḥammad
                                                    would repeat the verses as they were revealed to him, confirming
                                                    their correctness with Angel Jibrīl. Furthermore, the companions of
                                                    the Prophet, designated as scribes, would document the revelations,
                                                    forming the primary corpus of the Qurʾān (Dutton 1999, 70).

                                                    In the early years of Islam, transcribing the Qurʾānic revelations
                                                    was a crucial task entrusted to a select group of individuals known
                                                    as the scribes (Kātib, pl. Kuttab). They played an indispensable
                                                    role in the preservation and propagation of the Qurʾān as they were
                                                    responsible for the physical transcription of the divine revelations
                                                    received by the Prophet Muḥammad.

                                                <p>
                                                    The Prophet Muḥammad, although unlettered, directed the scribes in
                                                    their task. The revelations were dictated to these scribes, who
                                                    would then write them down on various materials available at the
                                                    time, including parchment, leather, palm stalks, and shoulder blades
                                                    of camels (Dutton 1999, 66). The Prophet would then have the written
                                                    verses read back to him as a means of verification, ensuring their
                                                    accuracy in recording the revealed verses.

                                                <p>
                                                    The role of these scribes was crucial due to two primary factors.
                                                    Firstly, the Qurʾān was initially preserved and disseminated through
                                                    an oral culture that valued memorisation and Recitation. The
                                                    scribes’ written records provided an additional layer of
                                                    preservation that catered to an expanding community, gradually
                                                    shifting towards a written culture (Stewart 2007, 165). These early
                                                    transcripts served as reference points, alongside oral Recitation,
                                                    facilitating the Qurʾān’s accurate transmission across different
                                                    geographical locations.

                                                <p>

                                                    Secondly, the Kuttab played a central role in managing the sequence
                                                    of the Qurʾānic revelations. The order of the Qurʾānic verses (āyāt)
                                                    and chapters (sūrahs) as we have today does not reflect the
                                                    chronological order of their revelation. This arrangement was made
                                                    under the guidance of the Prophet, with the Angel Jibrīl reviewing
                                                    the entire Qurʾān with the Prophet each Ramadan and arranging the
                                                    verses in their present order (Al-Itqan fi Ulum alQur’an, al-Suyuti
                                                    2007, 172). The scribes adjusted the written transcripts, ensuring
                                                    they mirrored this divinely sanctioned order

                                                <p>
                                                    The diligence of these early scribes was pivotal to the compilation
                                                    of the Qurʾān into a single volume (muṣḥaf) during the caliphate of
                                                    Abu Bakr. Zaid ibn Thabit was tasked with collecting all Qurʾānic
                                                    materials, cross-verifying them with oral recitations, and compiling
                                                    them into a single text (Siddique 2008, 202). This endeavour relied
                                                    heavily on the accuracy of the scribes’ initial recordings and their
                                                    preservation of the verses in their correct sequence.

                                                    With the subsequent spread of Islam beyond the Arabian Peninsula and
                                                    the increasing number of converts unfamiliar with Arabic, a
                                                    standardised Qurʾān text became necessary. This need led to the
                                                    compilation of the ʿUthmānic codex’ during the caliphate of ʿUthmān
                                                    bin ʿAffān. The scribes, including Zaid ibn Thabit, undertook this
                                                    momentous task, producing several copies of the Qurʾān in the
                                                    Quraishi dialect, which were then dispatched to the central

                                                    known as the ʿUthmānic codex, marks a defining period in the early
                                                    history of Islam. It was during the caliphate of the third caliph,
                                                    ʿUthmān ibn ʿAffān, that this critical undertaking occurred, a
                                                    pivotal response to the increasing linguistic and geographical
                                                    diversity of the expanding Muslim community

                                                <p>
                                                    The codification process was sparked by reported discrepancies in
                                                    the Qurʾānic recitations among the Muslim troops during the campaign
                                                    in Armenia and Azerbaijan (Burton 1977, 144). Ḥuḍayfah ibn
                                                    al-Yamān, upon his return, urged Caliph ʿUthmān to “save this nation
                                                    before they differ about the Book (the Qurʾān) as Jews and the
                                                    Christians did before” (Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī, 4987). This plea
                                                    signalled the urgency of unifying the Qurʾānic text to prevent the
                                                    burgeoning Ummah from fragmentation over textual divergences.

                                                <p>
                                                    Responding to this crucial concern, ʿUthmān assembled a committee
                                                    headed by Zayd ibn Thābit and other notable Companions during the
                                                    Prophet’s lifetime. Their primary task was to compile a universally
                                                    accepted text, deriving from the existing Ṣuḥuf of Abu Bakr that was
                                                    in the custody of Umm al-Muʾminīn Hafṣah (al-Azami 2003, 97).

                                                    One of the defining features of the ʿUthmānic codex was the
                                                    retention of the Quraishi dialect, the dialect of the Prophet
                                                    Muḥammad himself. The Qurʾān was initially revealed and recited in
                                                    this dialect, a fact attested to in numerous ḥadīths (al-Suyūṭī
                                                    2007, 67). Given its clarity and eloquence, this particular dialect
                                                    of Arabic held a high status within the Arabian Peninsula. By
                                                    preserving the Qurʾān in this dialect, ʿUthmān ensured that the
                                                    divine message retained its original linguistic style and beauty.

                                                    The decision to standardise the Qurʾān in the Quraishi dialect had
                                                    significant implications. Notably, it helped to eliminate potential
                                                    variations and discrepancies arising from dialectal differences
                                                    across the Arabian Peninsula. This action, in effect, conserved the
                                                    linguistic integrity of the Qurʾān while facilitating its
                                                    memorisation and Recitation across diverse linguistic communities
                                                    (Neuwirth 2014, 245).

                                                    The ʿUthmānic codex was then duplicated, and copies were dispatched
                                                    to the central provinces of the expanding Empire. Simultaneously,
                                                    all personal copies and transcripts were ordered to be destroyed,
                                                    thereby unifying the Muslim Ummah under a single version of the
                                                    Qurʾān (Al-Itqan fi Ulum al-Qur’an, al-Suyūṭī 2007, 172).

                                                    This decisive action by Caliph ʿUthmān, though met with some
                                                    resistance, was largely successful in standardising the Qurʾānic
                                                    text. The ʿUthmānic codex has since served as the unchallenged text
                                                    of the Qurʾān for the Muslim Ummah worldwide, fulfilling the divine

                                                    unique oneness. This monotheistic principle is affirmed in the

                                                    This concept of monotheism, a distinguishing feature of Islam, sets
                                                    it apart from polytheistic beliefs, reinforcing God’s
                                                    incommensurability. Simultaneously, the Qurʾān also describes God
                                                    using a set of 99 attributes or “beautiful names” (al-asmāʾ
                                                    al-ḥusnā). These include names that evoke God’s mercy and
                                                    compassion, such as al-Raḥmān and al-Raḥīm. Other names represent

                                                    Qurʾān. God is often described as “towards the people merciful and
                                                    compassionate” (Q. 2:143). This mercy is not limited but is
                                                    described as encompassing all things (Q. 7:156), demonstrating the

                                                    predominantly due to human disbelief and misdeeds (Q. 2:7). This
                                                    portrayal instils a profound sense of moral responsibility and
                                                    accountability among the believers. It balances the images of divine
                                                    mercy and kindness, underscoring the need for justice and the

                                                    God in the Qurʾān. God is consistently described as being near His

                                                    (ʾAwliyāʾ), and His enemies are established in intricate detail,
                                                    illuminating a framework of divine-human interaction predicated on
                                                    moral, spiritual, and theological considerations.

                                                    The Qurʾān presents God’s ‘friends’ or ʾAwliyāʾ as those who believe
                                                    and act righteously. The term ʾAwliyāʾ, often translated as
                                                    ‘friends,’ ‘protectors,’ or ‘allies,’ indicates a special
                                                    relationship of closeness and alliance with God. For instance, the

                                                    These verses highlight faith (īmān) and piety (taqwā) as defining
                                                    features of the ʾAwliyāʾ. On the other hand, the Qurʾān’s portrayal
                                                    of God’s enemies is typified by disbelief (kufr), rejection of God’s

                                                    a rejection of God’s guidance and an unwillingness to accept the

                                                    The Qurʾān does not present these categories as fixed or immutable.
                                                    Individuals have the capacity for moral and spiritual change.
                                                    Disbelievers can become believers, and those who have sinned can
                                                    seek forgiveness and reform their behaviour. The Qurʾān states,

                                                    sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah
                                                    forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the

                                                    This emphasis on divine mercy and forgiveness illustrates the
                                                    potential for spiritual transformation, even for those previously at
                                                    odds with God. The relationships between God, His friends, and His
                                                    enemies in the Qurʾān are intrinsically tied to notions of divine
                                                    justice. The Qurʾān frequently reminds its readers that while God is
                                                    the Most Merciful (al-Raḥmān), He is also the Most Just (al-ʿAdl),
                                                    and His judgement will reflect the perfect balance of these
                                                    attributes. God’s friends will be rewarded for their faith and
                                                    piety, while His enemies will face the consequences of their
                                                    disbelief and transgressions.

                                                    Yet, in the Qurʾānic worldview, God’s mercy invariably overshadows

                                                    most merciful’” (Q. 6:54).

                                                    This verse suggests that even the so-called ‘enemies of God’ are not
                                                    beyond the reach of divine compassion. God’s judgement, therefore,
                                                    is always tempered by His mercy, and the door to repentance and
                                                    reform is perennially open. Furthermore, the Qurʾānic portrayal of
                                                    these relationships provides believers with an ethical and spiritual
                                                    guide. The ʾAwliyāʾ are role models, exemplifying faith and virtuous
                                                    conduct, while the depiction of God’s enemies is a stern warning
                                                    against disbelief and immoral behaviour. Thus, the Qurʾān provides
                                                    moral guidance and encourages the pursuit of spiritual excellence
                                                    (iḥsān).

                                                <P>
                                                    Another noteworthy aspect is the Qurʾān’s emphasis on the relational
                                                    dynamics between God and humanity. God’s friends are promised His
                                                    support, guidance, and protection in worldly life and the Hereafter
                                                    (Q. 10:62-64). This divine patronage is a significant aspect of the
                                                    believers’ relationship with God, reinforcing their faith and trust
                                                    in Him. Conversely, God’s enemies are warned of divine chastisement,
                                                    a consequence of their rejection of God’s guidance. This punitive
                                                    element is not driven by religious animosity but manifests divine
                                                    justice (ʿadl) and upholds moral and spiritual order

                                                    The Qurʾān is firmly anchored in the Abrahamic tradition,
                                                    acknowledging the continuity of prophetic messages while
                                                    establishing itself as the final, definitive revelation. This
                                                    acknowledgement is not merely a historical affirmation; it carries
                                                    significant theological and moral implications that shape the
                                                    Qurʾānic worldview.

                                                    Abraham (Ibrāhīm) occupies a central position in the Qurʾān’s
                                                    depiction of prophetic history. Described as a ‘model’ (uswah, Q.
                                                    16:120), a ‘nation’ (ummatan, Q. 16:120), and a ‘righteous man’ (Q.
                                                    37:110), Abraham embodies the paradigm of monotheistic faith and
                                                    moral excellence. Notably, the Qurʾān identifies him as a
                                                    monotheist, a Muslim’ (Q. 3:67), a terminology that characterises
                                                    Abraham’s religious stance and positions him within the trajectory
                                                    that culminates in the faith.

                                                    The Qurʾān confirms the validity of the previous revelations given
                                                    to Abraham, Moses (Mūsā), and Jesus (ʿĪsā), among others,

                                                    This verse signifies its affirmation of the truths of the preceding
                                                    Abrahamic scriptures. Simultaneously, it declares itself as Muhaymin
                                                    (supervisory, guardian) over them, an attribute denoting its
                                                    capacity to authenticate the actual teachings of the previous
                                                    scriptures and correct any distortions or misinterpretations. This
                                                    role emerges from the Qurʾān being a ‘criterion’ (furqān) that
                                                    distinguishes truth from falsehood (Q. 25:1).

                                                <P>In fulfilling this role, the Qurʾān introduces the concept of
                                                    ‘completion’ or ‘perfection’ of the divine guidance that commenced
                                                    with the Abrahamic tradition. It achieves this in several key ways.

                                                    First, the Qurʾān ‘completes’ the Abrahamic law by providing a
                                                    comprehensive code of life that governs all aspects of human
                                                    conduct. It extends the Abrahamic ethical mandate to include a
                                                    detailed social, economic, political, and personal ethics system
                                                    that integrates the spiritual and temporal domains. This vision of
                                                    ethical comprehensiveness is encapsulated in the Qurʾānic verse,

                                                    Second, the Qurʾān ‘completes’ the Abrahamic law by resolving
                                                    ambiguities and clarifying misinterpretations in the previous
                                                    scriptures. This role is explicitly stated in several Qurʾānic

                                                    and rectifying the Abrahamic tradition’s distortions. Third, the
                                                    Qurʾān ‘completes’ the Abrahamic law by reaffirming the core message
                                                    of monotheism (tawḥīd) and restoring it to its original purity. It
                                                    critiques the polytheistic practices and doctrinal deviations that
                                                    had infiltrated the Abrahamic tradition, returning to the

                                                    concept of universality. While the previous scriptures were
                                                    primarily addressed to specific communities, the Qurʾān presents

                                                    The Qurʾān offers a wealth of narratives encompassing various
                                                    Prophets within its verses, weaving a tapestry of interconnected
                                                    stories that communicate core theological and ethical teachings.
                                                    Drawing from the common heritage of the Abrahamic tradition, the
                                                    Qurʾānic accounts of Prophets often echo, extend, and, at times,

                                                    Prominent among these accounts is the story of Adam (Q. 2:30-39),
                                                    which sets the theological backdrop for human existence and moral
                                                    responsibility. Unlike the Biblical narrative, the Qurʾān emphasises
                                                    Adam’s role as a vicegerent (khalīfa) on Earth, reflecting the
                                                    worldview of humans as trustees of God’s creation. Moreover, the
                                                    Qurʾānic rendition underscores the notion of God’s mercy and
                                                    forgiveness following Adam’s repentance, establishing a framework of

                                                    The Qurʾānic narratives about Prophets such as Noah (Nūḥ), Abraham
                                                    (Ibrāhīm), Moses (Mūsā), and Jesus (ʿĪsā) are replete with motifs of
                                                    monotheism, prophetic resilience, and moral uprightness. For
                                                    example, the story of Abraham (Q. 2:124-141) portrays him as a model
                                                    of monotheistic devotion, challenging the polytheism of his people
                                                    and undergoing trials in his quest for truth. Similarly, the account
                                                    of Moses (Q. 20:9-98), while sharing several elements with the
                                                    Biblical Exodus narrative, emphasises the transformative power of

                                                    ordering, instead weaving the stories of different Prophets together
                                                    in a thematic arrangement. This narrative technique facilitates the
                                                    extraction of moral and theological lessons across other prophetic
                                                    stories, reinforcing the Qurʾān’s broader ethical and spiritual
                                                    messages.

                                                    A distinct aspect of the Qurʾānic accounts of Prophets is their
                                                    depiction as mortal, fallible beings who, despite their prophethood,
                                                    are not immune to human emotions or moral struggles. For example,
                                                    the story of Jonah (Yūnus) highlights his moment of despair in the
                                                    belly of the whale, serving as a poignant reminder of divine mercy
                                                    and the importance of patience and repentance,

                                                    him with the Holy Spirit. So how is it that, whenever a messenger
                                                    brings you something you do not like, you become arrogant, calling
                                                    some impostors and killing others?” (Q. 2:87).

                                                    Yet, the Qurʾān also critically engages with the religious
                                                    communities of Jews and Christians. It affirms the divine origin of
                                                    their scriptures, the Torah and the Gospel, while critiquing their
                                                    interpretation and application. For instance, the Qurʾān accuses the
                                                    Jewish community of distorting the meanings of their scriptures,

                                                    Some Jews distort the meaning of [revealed] words: they say, ‘We

                                                    hear,’ and ‘Raina [Look at us],’ twisting it abusively with their
                                                    tongues to disparage religion. If they had said, ‘We hear and obey,’

                                                    and more proper for them. However, God has spurned them for their

                                                    Interestingly, the Qurʾān extends its narrative beyond the confines
                                                    of historical Judaism and Christianity, highlighting the shared
                                                    heritage and divergences in religious thought. It asserts the
                                                    arrival of Prophet Muḥammad as the ‘Seal of the Prophets’ (Q.
                                                    33:40), positioning Islam as the final and complete manifestation of
                                                    the Abrahamic tradition. Muḥammad’s mission, the Qurʾān posits, aims
                                                    to rectify deviations, fulfil the prophecy of a final messenger (Q.

                                                    The Qurʾān repeatedly emphasises its function as a confirmation and
                                                    a guardian over the previous scriptures (Q. 5:48), underscoring the
                                                    continuity of divine revelation within the Abrahamic tradition. The
                                                    Qurʾān, in its view, provides the definitive interpretation of God’s
                                                    will, revealing the original monotheistic faith (‘the religion of

                                                    parables are meant to drive home spiritual, moral, and social

                                                    scenarios can be evaluated. The Qurʾān explains the function of its

                                                    time, place, and cultural context. This use of parables aligns the
                                                    Qurʾān with other scriptural texts, such as the parables used in the
                                                    Christian New Testament (Haleem 2005). Notably, the Qurʾān employs
                                                    pre-Abrahamic parables in several instances. For instance, it refers
                                                    to the ancient civilisation of ‘Ad and their influential leader Hud,
                                                    whose story is a cautionary tale about arrogance and the perils of
                                                    rejecting divine guidance (Q. 7:65-72). Similarly, the story of the
                                                    Pharaoh and Moses, though post-Abrahamic in chronology, is a
                                                    reiteration of an older, pre-Abrahamic motif: the divine
                                                    confrontation with tyrannical power, typifying the struggle between
                                                    good and evil (Q. 28:3- 42).

                                                    more directly associated with monotheistic faith. A particularly

                                                    akin to the vitality and productivity of a firmly rooted tree. It is
                                                    an image directly relatable to the agricultural societies that
                                                    populated the Arabian Peninsula and the Levant, thus highlighting
                                                    the Qurʾān’s conscious endeavour to communicate in a language and

                                                    The Qurʾānic parables bridge the divine message and human
                                                    understanding, offering tangible illustrations of spiritual
                                                    principles. Whether drawing on pre- or post-Abrahamic contexts,
                                                    these parables invite reflection and introspection, encouraging the
                                                    reader to engage with the text beyond the literal level and to
                                                    extract deeper, more profound meanings.

                                                    By utilising such parables, the Qurʾān acknowledges the complex
                                                    fabric of human experience, drawing from historical and contemporary
                                                    events to communicate divine truths. This dynamic interaction
                                                    between text and reader, mediated through parables, enhances the
                                                    Qurʾān’s accessibility and enduring relevance, fostering a personal,
                                                    individualised engagement with the text as varied as its audience.

                                                    Parables also serve the dual purpose of conveying profound insights
                                                    and encouraging the audience to engage actively with the text. The
                                                    Qurʾān beckons its readers to probe, reflect, and seek understanding
                                                    beyond the superficial layer. Qurʾānic parables invite the readers
                                                    to exercise their cognitive faculties to discern the wisdom they
                                                    encapsulate. As echoed in Qurʾānic exhortation, this dynamic fosters
                                                    a deeper, more personal, and ultimately transformative interaction
                                                    with the text (Mir 1986). Parables, therefore, represent a powerful
                                                    tool in the Qurʾān’s pedagogical approach, as they can foster
                                                    understanding across diverse audiences. For instance, the parable of
                                                    the spider’s house in the Qurʾān,

                                                    building themselves houses- the spider’s is the frailest of all
                                                    houses- if only they could understand” (Q. 29:41).

                                                    This parable illustrates the frailty of associating partners with
                                                    God (shirk) in a readily graspable way across cultures and
                                                    generations. Similarly, the Qurʾān’s use of parables enables it to
                                                    impart moral teachings. One example is the parable of the life of
                                                    this world as water sent down from the sky, turning the Earth green
                                                    before becoming stubble scattered by the wind (Q. 18:45). This
                                                    parable underscores the transitory nature of worldly life,
                                                    highlighting the importance of focusing on eternal life in the
                                                    Hereafter.

                                                    The Qurʾān’s parables offer a plethora of moral and ethical
                                                    teachings, encapsulating wisdom across multiple spheres of human
                                                    existence. These teachings serve as guidelines for personal conduct
                                                    and inform broader social interactions and societal norms. This
                                                    section seeks to delve deeper into these moral and ethical teachings
                                                    gleaned from Qurʾānic parables. Arguably, the most significant moral
                                                    principle permeating the Qurʾān’s parables is Tawḥīd. A poignant
                                                    demonstration of this principle is evident in the parable of the

                                                </P>
                                                <P>
                                                    God’s nature, as the unseen divine being, is presented through a
                                                    series of ‘beautiful names’ (Asmā’ al-Ḥusna) that denote His
                                                    attributes (Q. 7:180). God is depicted as the All-Knowing (‘Alīm),
                                                    All-Seeing (Baṣīr), and Ever-Living (Ḥayy), among others (Haleem
                                                    2005, 112). These characterisations convey an omnipresent,
                                                    omniscient and omnipotent deity, shaping the believers’ conception
                                                    of God and their relationship with Him.

                                                <P>
                                                    Moreover, the Qurʾān portrays the spiritual world’s unseen entities,
                                                    angels and Jinn. Angels are depicted as God’s obedient servants,
                                                    performing various tasks, such as delivering revelations to prophets
                                                    (Q. 2:97), recording human deeds (Q. 82:10-12), and taking souls at
                                                    death (Q. 32:11). Jinn, on the other hand, are another unseen
                                                    creation with free will, similar to humans, and can be good or evil
                                                    (Q. 72:11).
                                                </P>
                                                <P>
                                                    The Qurʾān provides vivid descriptions of life after death,
                                                    detailing the rewards and punishments in the Hereafter. The
                                                    depictions of Paradise (Jannah) include gardens beneath which rivers
                                                    flow (Q. 2:25), fruits and meats of desire (Q. 56:20-21), and pure
                                                    companions (Q. 44:54). In contrast, Hell (Jahannam) is depicted with
                                                    intense heat (Q. 9:81), boiling water (Q. 14:16), and a choking food
                                                    of bitter thorn-fruit (Q. 88:6-7) (Haleem 2005, 8, 528, 414, 94,
                                                    175, 632). These descriptions serve as moral motivators, encouraging
                                                    righteousness and deterring wrongdoing.
                                                </P>
                                                <P>
                                                    Predestination, or divine decree (Qadr), is another unseen concept
                                                    in the Qurʾān. It teaches that all events, good or bad, occur
                                                    according to God’s will (Q. 9:51). This belief instils in Muslims a
                                                    sense of contentment and patience during trials and tribulations,
                                                    acknowledging the ultimate wisdom of God’s plan (Haleem 2005, 167).
                                                </P>
                                                <P>
                                                    Essentially, the Qurʾānic portrayals of the unseen seek to nurture
                                                    faith by illustrating elements beyond the physical world’s confines.
                                                    These descriptions offer a nuanced understanding of the divine, the
                                                    spiritual, the eschatological, and the predestined, inviting
                                                    believers to reflect deeper on life, morality, and their
                                                    relationship with God.

                                                    One of the ways the Qurʾān rectifies historical narratives is by
                                                    reframing stories of past prophets and communities. Many of these
                                                    accounts, found in the Jewish and Christian scriptures, are retold
                                                    with different emphases, often to highlight moral or theological
                                                    lessons (Q. 4:163; Q. 6:83-90). For example, the Qurʾānic account of
                                                    Prophet Moses diverges significantly from the Biblical narrative.
                                                    While the Bible describes Moses’ impatience (Exodus 32:19), the
                                                    Qurʾān often portrays him as a model of patience (Q. 28:14-28;
                                                    Haleem 2005, 62-66). This reframing serves to highlight virtues
                                                    valued in the moral code.

                                                <P>
                                                    In addition, the Qurʾān rectifies historical narratives by
                                                    challenging prevalent societal customs and beliefs of the time. Pre-
                                                    Arabian society (Jahiliyya) is criticised for its moral and social
                                                    failings, such as female infanticide (Q. 16:58-59), idol worship (Q.
                                                    6:74), and unregulated polygamy (Q. 4:3). By introducing new
                                                    regulations and moral codes, the Qurʾān aimed to reform these
                                                    societal norms (Haleem 2005, 219-221, 74, 68).

                                                <P>
                                                    Furthermore, the Qurʾān corrects distortions and interpolations
                                                    (Tahrif) that had crept into earlier scriptures (Q. 2:79; Q.
                                                    5:13-15). It asserts that some People of the Book altered the words
                                                    from their proper places and forgot a good part of the message (Q.
                                                    5:13-15). By presenting itself as a guard over previous revelations
                                                    (Q. 5:48), the Qurʾān seeks to restore the original divine message
                                                    it believes was lost or distorted in earlier texts (Haleem 2005, 21,
                                                    86-88).

                                                <P>
                                                    The Qurʾān also uniquely retells history by emphasising events’
                                                    spiritual and moral aspects over mere factual reporting. The Battle
                                                    of Badr, for instance, is depicted less as a military encounter and
                                                    more as a testament to divine aid and the importance of unity and
                                                    trust in God (Q. 8:9-19; Haleem 2005, 144-147).

                                                    The Qurʾān’s Address to ‘People of the Book’
                                                </P>

                                                    The Qurʾān’s interaction with the “People of the Book” (Ahl
                                                    al-Kitāb) constitutes a vital aspect of its broader discourse. This
                                                    term refers to the Jews and Christians who had received scriptures
                                                    before the revelation of the Qurʾān (Q. 3:64). The Qurʾān employs a
                                                    variety of rhetorical strategies to address them, engaging them in
                                                    dialogue, challenging their theological positions, inviting them to
                                                    Islam, and at times admonishing them for their deviations (Q. 4:46;
                                                    Q. 5:15).
                                                </P>
                                                <P>
                                                    This engagement with the “People of the Book” is evident in several
                                                    Qurʾānic themes. Firstly, the Qurʾān acknowledges the previous
                                                    revelations and their recipients. It recognises the Torah and the
                                                    Gospel as revelations from God and views Jewish prophets and Jesus
                                                    as integral parts of the prophetic tradition (Q. 5:44-46; Haleem
                                                    2005, 84-85). By doing so, the Qurʾān situates itself within the
                                                    broader Abrahamic tradition, establishing a continuity of
                                                    monotheistic faith (Q. 2:136).

                                                <P>
                                                    Secondly, the Qurʾān critically engages with their beliefs. It
                                                    questions the Jewish rejection of Jesus and Christian doctrines such
                                                    as the Trinity and the divinity of Jesus (Q. 4:171; Q. 5:72- 73).
                                                    This critique, however, should not be mistaken as an outright
                                                    dismissal. It should be seen as a dialogic engagement seeking to
                                                    correct what the Qurʾān views as theological deviations (Haleem
                                                    2005, 76-78).
                                                </P>
                                                <P>
                                                    The Qurʾān further challenges the “People of the Book” by
                                                    highlighting their failure to uphold their religious commandments.
                                                    It critiques them for distorting their scriptures and for their
                                                    selective adherence to their religious laws (Q. 2:79; Q. 5:13). It
                                                    also reproaches them for their exclusivist claims to salvation and

                                                    these critiques, the Qurʾān maintains a conciliatory stance towards
                                                    the People of the Book. It extends an invitation to them to join the

                                                    The Qurʾān’s critique of the “People of the Book” could be seen as
                                                    an internal critique within the Abrahamic tradition rather than an
                                                    external critique of a different religion. The Qurʾān presents
                                                    itself as the custodian of the monotheistic tradition, seeking to
                                                    restore it to its original purity from the perceived distortions and
                                                    deviations (Haleem 2005, 76-78). This sense of restorative justice
                                                    underpins the Qurʾān’s critique and dialogue with the People of the
                                                    Book.

                                                    Interestingly, the Qurʾān recognises the “People of the Book” as the
                                                    legitimate recipients of God’s revelations. This recognition
                                                    transcends mere tolerance; it signifies respect for their religious
                                                    identity and a validation of their spiritual experiences. This
                                                    Qurʾānic stance has necessary implications for interfaith relations,
                                                    advocating a model of engagement based on mutual recognition and
                                                    respect (Haleem 2005, 646-647).

                                                    critique of the Children of Israel, presents an intriguing and
                                                    complex moment within the Qurʾānic discourse. The verse is

                                                    better and more proper for them. But God has spurned them for their

                                                    linguistic and thematic complexity. Firstly, the verse serves as a
                                                    direct commentary on the supposed disobedience and distortion of the
                                                    revealed words by a specific Jewish community group. However, it is
                                                    crucial to note that the Qurʾān, in this verse, does not accuse the
                                                    entire Jewish community but only a specific group purported to have
                                                    twisted the meanings of God’s words.

                                                <P>
                                                    ‘We hear and disobey’ represent the exact antithesis of a
                                                    fundamental tenet ‘we hear, and we obey’ (Haleem 2005, 89). This
                                                    phrase signifies submission to God’s commands and is a crucial
                                                    aspect of the faith. The alleged distortion and reversal of this
                                                    phrase by the group mentioned in the verse signify a blatant
                                                    disregard for divine instructions, which the Qurʾān strongly
                                                    criticises.

                                                    The Qurʾān then outlines an appropriate response that would have
                                                    been ‘better and more proper’ for the accused group. The suggested
                                                    phrases contain words similar to ‘Ra’ina,’ which means ‘Look at us.’
                                                    However, they do not carry the double entendre that could be misused
                                                    to disparage the divine Law.

                                                    Finally, the verse concludes with a harsh denouncement, indicating
                                                    that God has rejected them for their disobedience, implying their
                                                    spiritual downfall. It thus communicates a stern warning about the
                                                    grave consequences of distorting divine words, reinforcing the
                                                    centrality of compliance and sincerity in engaging with divine
                                                    revelation.

                                                    and a call to enlightenment, drawing the attention of the ‘People of

                                                    Abrahamic path by accepting and following the Qurʾān. The balance
                                                    between these roles encapsulates a theme of divine mercy and
                                                    justice, fundamental to Qurʾānic theology.

                                                    The ‘light’ and ‘Scripture’ mentioned in the verse can be
                                                    interpreted as the Qurʾān itself (Haleem, 2005, 119). This alludes
                                                    to the Qurʾān as a beacon of guidance, illuminating the path towards
                                                    Peace. Notably, this guidance is not only theoretical but
                                                    transformative. The verse vividly describes the Qurʾān’s impact: it
                                                    brings its followers ‘from darkness out into light’. This metaphor
                                                    symbolises an ideological transition from ignorance (jahiliyya) to
                                                    knowledge (‘ilm), reflecting the Qurʾān’s ambition to educate and
                                                    enlighten its audience.

                                                <P>
                                                    The verse further elaborates on the direction of this guidance: it
                                                    is towards a straight path.’ This notion of the ‘straight path’
                                                    (Ṣirāṭ al-mustaqīm) recurs throughout the Qurʾān, representing the
                                                    ideal way of life aligned with God’s will. By identifying the Qurʾān
                                                    as a guide to this path, the verse highlights its centrality in
                                                    defining and shaping moral and ethical norms in tradition.

                                                    Finally, the verse situates this entire transformative process
                                                    within God’s will. This attribute underscores the omnipotence and
                                                    sovereignty of God, positioning the Qurʾānic revelation within the
                                                    broader divine plan.

                                                    At its core, this verse succinctly encapsulates the fundamental
                                                    tenets of the faith. It is a call to monotheism, obedience to divine
                                                    revelation, and rejection of polytheism, themes that are fundamental
                                                    to the Qurʾānic message.
                                                </P>
                                                <P>
                                                    The verse begins with an exhortation to follow the revelations
                                                    received from God. This directive can be seen as a command to
                                                    Muḥammad and, by extension, the broader Muslim community. The term
                                                    ‘revealed’ evokes the Qurʾān’s status as divine revelation,
                                                    underlining its authority as a spiritual and ethical guidance
                                                    source. It reaffirms that the Qurʾān is not a product of human
                                                    authorship but God’s Scripture directly bestowed upon Muḥammad
                                                    (Haleem, 2005, 141).

                                                <P>
                                                    The verse then advances to a clear articulation of monotheism, often
                                                    considered the cornerstone of belief: “There is no God but Him”.
                                                    This statement declares God’s oneness, an uncompromising affirmation
                                                    of monotheism that distinguishes Islam from polytheistic religions.
                                                    It categorically rejects the existence of any deity other than God
                                                    and solidifies the central position of monotheism (Haleem, 2005,
                                                    141).

                                                <P>
                                                    The final directive of the verse is to ‘turn away’ from those who
                                                    associate other deities with God. The phrase ‘join other gods with
                                                    Him’ references the act of shirk, or polytheism, viewed as the most
                                                    grievous sin. It marks a clear boundary between the followers of
                                                    Islam and those of other faiths (Haleem, 2005, 141).

                                                <P>
                                                    This verse can be viewed as a concise summary of the path, marked by
                                                    obedience to divine revelation, affirmation of monotheism, and
                                                    steadfast rejection of polytheism. As such, it serves as a guiding
                                                    principle, illuminating the path that Muslims are to tread.
                                                    Moreover, it positions the Qurʾān as a beacon of guidance, offering
                                                    clear directions for its followers and cementing its status as a
                                                    source of divinely ordained knowledge and wisdom.

                                                    In conclusion, verse 6:106 of the Qurʾān serves as a strong
                                                    statement of the fundamental principles of Islam, encapsulating the
                                                    essence of its message within a single poem. It highlights the
                                                    centrality of the Qurʾān as divine revelation, reaffirms the bedrock
                                                    of monotheism upon which the faith is built, and underscores the
                                                    uncompromising stance against polytheism.

                                                    The Qurʾān has a unique relationship with Ahl al-Kitāb. As used in
                                                    the Qurʾān, this term primarily refers to Jews and Christians who
                                                    have received earlier revelations from God in the form of the Torah
                                                    and the Gospel, respectively. The Qurʾān encourages the Ahl al-Kitāb
                                                    to accept and follow its teachings, positioning itself as God’s
                                                    final and most complete revelation. A crucial verse in this regard
                                                    is Q. 5:68,

                                                    faith. The Qurʾān’s assertion of its authority and legitimacy within
                                                    the broader Abrahamic tradition is based on its self-perception as

                                                    This verse reinforces the Qurʾān’s purpose in providing clarity and
                                                    guidance to humanity, furthering its role as a final testament in
                                                    the Abrahamic tradition. Examining these verses elucidates the
                                                    Qurʾān’s understanding of its role within the Abrahamic traditions,
                                                    its relationship with the Ahl al-Kitāb, and its function as a divine
                                                    guide. It underlines the Qurʾān’s affirmation of its authority and
                                                    legitimacy, divine protection, and role as a guiding force for
                                                    humanity. The Qurʾān has multiple functions, playing a significant
                                                    role as a guide (huda), a reminder (dhikr), and a bringer of good
                                                    news (Bashar). These aspects are emphasised throughout the Qurʾānic
                                                    text, shaping the Muslim perception of the Qurʾān’s purpose and
                                                    spiritual significance.

                                                    As a guide, the Qurʾān provides a navigational framework for
                                                    individuals to lead a life in harmony with divine principles. For

                                                    “It was in the month of Ramadan that the Quran was revealed as
                                                    guidance for mankind, clear messages giving guidance and

                                                    later. God wants ease for you, not hardship. He wants you to

                                                    This passage portrays the Qurʾān as a universal guide that provides
                                                    clear principles to distinguish right from wrong. Regarding its
                                                    function as a reminder, the Qurʾān frequently prompts its readers to
                                                    remember and reflect upon the divine messages it contains. The word

                                                    The Qurʾān here is not just a spiritual guide or reminder; it also
                                                    brings its followers the glad tidings of spiritual fulfilment and
                                                    divine mercy. However, these three roles of the Qurʾān should not be
                                                    considered in isolation; they are interconnected and mutually
                                                    reinforcing. The Qurʾān as a guide is essential for individuals to
                                                    navigate their lives in line with divine principles. Its function as
                                                    a reminder aids in keeping these principles alive in individuals’
                                                    minds and hearts, prompting continuous engagement and contemplation.
                                                    Simultaneously, the Qurʾān, as a bringer of good news, encourages

                                                    virtuous life. Therefore, understanding the Qurʾān’s functions as a

                                                    guide. The Qurʾān is revered as the direct Word of God and is the
                                                    ultimate repository of divine knowledge and wisdom. Through this
                                                    multifaceted examination, it becomes evident that the Qurʾān’s
                                                    significance extends beyond its role as a religious text to

                                                    right and wrong and the written form of the text, respectively,
                                                    reflects its dual function as both a guide for moral conduct and an
                                                    embodiment of the divine word. Moreover, its delivery to Prophet

                                                    accommodating nature and ability to cater to the linguistic and
                                                    cultural diversity among the early Muslim community.

                                                    formation. Preserving the Qurayshi dialect underscores the effort to
                                                    maintain linguistic consistency and authenticity in the Qurʾānic

                                                    The Qurʾān’s portrayal of God’s relationships with His friends and
                                                    enemies, the accounts of prophets, and the depiction of the unseen
                                                    provide a comprehensive understanding of Islamic cosmology and
                                                    soteriology. Moreover, the Qurʾān’s engagement with the Abrahamic
                                                    tradition, rectification of historical narratives, and conversations
                                                    with the People of the Book serve as pivotal points for interfaith
                                                    dialogue and understanding.

                                                    The Qurʾān’s extensive use of parables pre- and post-Abraham, its
                                                    moral and ethical teachings derived from these parables, and its
                                                    explicit guidance for Ahl al-Kitāb all consolidate its position as a
                                                    source of moral and spiritual enlightenment.

                                                    In conclusion, the Qurʾān, in its various roles and representations,
                                                    is an anchor shaping our worldview and spiritual identities. It
                                                    offers a divine blueprint for ethical and moral conduct, provides
                                                    spiritual consolation, and stimulates intellectual engagement and
                                                    contemplation. As the divine word, the Qurʾān is an enduring
                                                    testament to the rich tapestry of Islamic thought and spirituality,
                                                    transcending time and space.

                                            <p>The Qurʾān, revered as God’s ultimate communication to humanity, is a sacred text of unparalleled significance. Revealed over a span of approximately 23 years in the 7th century CE, it captures the essence of a divine dialogue that transcends time, affirming the teachings of preceding scriptures while rectifying any deviations or distortions that may have crept in over time. Written in the exquisite Quraishi dialect, the Qurʾān is a literary phenomenon, showcasing the richness and grandeur of the Arabic language in its full glory.</p>

<p>“Indeed, this Qur’an guides to that which is most suitable…” (Qurʾān 17:9) With these words, the Qurʾān asserts itself not only as a masterpiece of literary excellence but also as a divine beacon of wisdom, enveloped in self-awareness and safeguarded by divine protection. It invites humanity to delve deep into its verses, reflect on its profound messages, and heed its guidance. The Qurʾān warns of neglecting its teachings, reminding believers of the scriptures granted to previous communities and affirming that those endowed with scripture, wisdom, and prophethood would never turn away from its core message, dedicating their worship solely to God.</p>

<p>Far beyond a religious scripture, the Qurʾān stands as a monumental pillar of Arabic literature and a guide for humanity, echoing its profound messages across the vast deserts of Arabia. It encompasses historical narratives, scientific marvels, moral guidelines, and societal blueprints, serving as a beacon of knowledge and guidance for every aspect of life. As the Furqān, the criterion distinguishes truth from falsehood, guiding believers on the path of righteousness.</p>

<p>The divine strategy behind the Qurʾān’s revelation and preservation is miraculous. To accommodate the linguistic diversity of Arab tribes, it was revealed in multiple wordings, or Aḥruf, ensuring that its message reached every heart and soul, transcending tribal affiliations. Despite the variations in wording, the integrity of the Qurʾān’s message remained steadfast across the Aḥruf, preserved through the meticulous efforts of the Prophet’s dedicated scribes.</p>

<p>These scribes, known as the Kuttab, were pivotal in ensuring the Qurʾān’s preservation, transcribing the divine revelations with unwavering fidelity. Their sacred task saw the Qurʾān immortalised on diverse materials, from parchment and leather to palm stalks and camel bones. These tangible artefacts served as touchstones for future generations to access and immerse themselves in the divine message.</p>

<p>With the reign of Abu Bakr came the unification of these sacred words into a single volume, a monumental task spearheaded by Zaid ibn Thabit. This effort ensured the Qurʾān’s preservation as a unified entity, further solidified during ʿUthmān’s reign with the establishment of the ʿUthmānic codex. This standardised text was disseminated throughout the empire, ensuring a consistent and unified Qurʾānic voice.</p>

<p>Yet, the completion of the Qurʾān marks not the end of divine guidance but the culmination of a comprehensive life blueprint. It builds upon previous scriptures, offering a holistic framework for human conduct, addressing uncertainties, rectifying misinterpretations, and expanding upon the laws of the Abrahamic tradition. With a clear message of monotheism, it purifies core beliefs and eradicates polytheistic distortions, extending its universal call to every soul and corner of humanity.</p>

<p>The Qurʾān intertwines the stories of prophets and their trials, creating a rich thematic tapestry. Drawing from the Abrahamic tradition, it offers fresh perspectives, and challenges established notions, serving as a moral compass guiding believers towards virtue, faith, and understanding. It validates the divine missions of prophets like Moses and Jesus, emphasising the universal lessons embedded in their stories, and introduces lesser-known prophets such as Ṣāliḥ and Hūd.</p>

<p>At the narrative’s core stands Abraham, or Ibrāhīm, a paragon of unwavering faith and monotheistic devotion, bridging the gap between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The Qurʾān accentuates the importance of monotheism, the struggle against polytheism, and the interconnectedness of the Abrahamic faiths, affirming the divine revelations bestowed upon previous generations.</p>

<p>The Qurʾān is a profound and encompassing text, serving as a guide, a source of divine wisdom, and a custodian of sacred revelations. It touches upon many topics, from moral injunctions to historical events, offering timeless wisdom and guidance for believers. Transcending linguistic and tribal boundaries, it speaks to every soul, imparting a universal message. The Qurʾān’s completion signifies not an end but the provision of a comprehensive guide for life, weaving together the stories of prophets to paint a vivid portrait of faith, resilience, and moral integrity. Above all, it is a testament to God’s unwavering love and guidance for humanity.</p>
