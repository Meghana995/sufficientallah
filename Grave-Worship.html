                                                <p>The veneration of graves, a practice deeply rooted in various
                                                    societies’ cultural and religious fabric, has been a subject of
                                                    significant debate and transformation within the Islamic tradition.
                                                    This practice, known as Ziyāra, originates in pre-Islamic times and
                                                    has evolved considerably with the advent of Islam and its teachings.
                                                </p>

                                                <p>Ziyāra, derived from the Arabic root word ” زور”, meaning ‘to visit’,
                                                    has ancient origins and holds a special place in the religious and
                                                    cultural traditions of various communities. While the term is
                                                    broadly associated with visiting revered sites, it primarily refers
                                                    to the pious visitation of the graves of prophets, saints, and other
                                                    revered figures in an Islamic context.</p>

                                                <p>In many East Asian cultures, particularly in China and Japan,
                                                    ancestors are revered and offered regular rituals, believing that
                                                    the deceased continues to play a role in the lives of the living.
                                                    They can bring fortune or misfortune based on how they are
                                                    remembered (Watson, 1988). This practice of ancestral veneration is
                                                    deeply rooted in the belief that deceased ancestors can influence
                                                    the lives of their descendants and can provide guidance, blessings,
                                                    and protection.</p>

                                                <p>Similarly, in ancient civilisations such as the Egyptians, Chinese,
                                                    and Greeks, strong beliefs about the afterlife and the role of the
                                                    deceased were held. The Egyptians, for instance, believed in the Ka
                                                    (spirit) and constructed elaborate tombs and rituals to ensure a
                                                    safe passage to the afterlife (David, 2002). The construction of
                                                    grand pyramids and burial tombs in ancient Egypt was a testament to
                                                    their belief in the continuity of life after death and the
                                                    importance of providing the deceased with a proper resting place.
                                                </p>

                                                <p>The veneration of graves and burial sites was also common in
                                                    pre-Islamic Arabia, intertwined with the region’s broader cultural
                                                    and religious landscape. The Arab tribes, influenced by animism,
                                                    polytheism, and ancestral worship, often revered specific graves,
                                                    attributing them with sacredness and spiritual power (Edward
                                                    Pococke, Specimen historiae Arabum (Oxford, 1649).) This reverence
                                                    was not limited to the Arab tribes alone; ancient Semitic cultures
                                                    also held similar beliefs and practices (Smith, Lectures on the
                                                    Religion of the Semites; and Smith, Kinship and Marriage in Early
                                                    Arabia.).</p>

                                                <p>The cult of ancestors, where the deceased were believed to possess
                                                    powers and could intercede for the living, was prevalent (Henninger,
                                                    ‘Pre-Islamic Bedouin Religion’, pp. 3–22.). This belief system was
                                                    manifested in various rituals, including the erection of stones at
                                                    graves, which, although not a widespread practice, was significant
                                                    in some instances (Schöller, The Living and the Dead in Islam, pp.
                                                    13–22.). In pre-Islamic Arabia, grave veneration was not an isolated
                                                    practice but was part of a broader tapestry of religious beliefs and
                                                    rituals. Tombs, graves, and burial sites often became focal points
                                                    for offerings, supplications, and, sometimes, idolatrous practices
                                                    (Peters, 1994).</p>

                                                <p>Before the advent of Islam, the Arabian Peninsula was home to various
                                                    tribal communities, each with its own set of rituals and practices.
                                                    Among these was the veneration of ancestors and the visitation of
                                                    their graves, a practice rooted in the belief that the deceased
                                                    could intercede with the divine on behalf of the living (Peters,
                                                    1994). This practice served as a means to maintain a connection with
                                                    one’s lineage and honour the memory of those who came before.</p>


                                                <p>The veneration of the dead and the reverence for ancestors are
                                                    practices observed across various cultures and civilisations
                                                    throughout history. These practices, often deeply rooted in
                                                    tradition, have shaped societies’ religious, social, and cultural
                                                    landscapes. Ancestral veneration serves as a means to strengthen
                                                    family and community ties. By remembering and honouring the dead,
                                                    the living are reminded of their roots and the values and traditions
                                                    passed down through generations (Klass, 1996). It provides a moral
                                                    framework where the living seek to lead virtuous lives to honour
                                                    their forebears and avoid bringing shame to their lineage
                                                    (Feuchtwang, 2001).</p>

                                                <p>While Islam acknowledges the importance of honouring the deceased and
                                                    maintaining a connection with one’s ancestors, it emphasises the
                                                    principle of monotheism and cautions against practices that may
                                                    compromise this foundational belief. Islam encourages the
                                                    remembrance and supplication of the deceased through prayer and acts
                                                    of charity rather than rituals that may be seen as idolatrous or
                                                    contrary to the teachings of monotheism.</p>

                                                <p>Throughout history, the erection of memorials and structures over
                                                    graves has been a common practice across various cultures and
                                                    civilisations. These structures, ranging from simple stone markers
                                                    to elaborate mausoleums, commemorate the deceased and symbolise
                                                    cultural, social, and sometimes political significance. They
                                                    represent a physical manifestation of society’s respect and
                                                    reverence for the departed.</p>

                                                <p>These structures often serve as cultural and historical significance
                                                    markers, preserving the memories of influential figures and events
                                                    for future generations (Petrie, 2002). The grandeur and intricacy of
                                                    a memorial can sometimes indicate the social status or the wealth of
                                                    the deceased or their family, serving as a testament to their
                                                    prominence in society (Kemp, 2006).</p>

                                                <p>They serve as tangible reminders of individuals’ impact on their
                                                    communities and the legacies they leave behind.</p>

                                                <p>In the Arabian context, the term “ansāb” (pl. of “nasb”) in Arabic
                                                    refers to stone markers or pillars, often erected to commemorate
                                                    significant events, places, or individuals. Historically, these
                                                    markers have held profound cultural and religious significance in
                                                    various societies. In pre-Islamic Arabia, they were commonly erected
                                                    as memorials at burial sites of revered tribal leaders or heroes.
                                                    These stone markers served as a remembrance of the deceased and a
                                                    symbol of tribal pride and unity (Hoyland, 2001). The ansāb were
                                                    often associated with tales of courage, wisdom, and leadership of
                                                    the heroes they commemorated. These tales were passed down through
                                                    generations, reinforcing tribal identities and values (Peters,
                                                    1994).</p>

                                                <p>While Islam acknowledges and respects the cultural practices of past
                                                    societies, it guides to ensure that such rules do not deviate from
                                                    its core monotheistic principles. Islam encourages simplicity and
                                                    humility in remembrance of the deceased, focusing on prayer and acts
                                                    of charity rather than elaborate structures or rituals that may be
                                                    seen as excessive or idolatrous.</p>

                                                <p>The rituals surrounding death and burial have been deeply ingrained
                                                    in human societies throughout history. These practices, often rooted
                                                    in cultural and religious beliefs, serve to express grief, honour
                                                    the deceased, and seek spiritual solace. In pre-Islamic Arabia, it
                                                    was customary for women to wail loudly and publicly mourn the death
                                                    of a family member or tribal leader. This ritual, known as “niyāḥa”,
                                                    was seen as a way to express grief and show respect for the deceased
                                                    (Jones, 1999).</p>


                                                <p>Animal sacrifices at graves were prevalent, believed to appease the
                                                    spirits or provide sustenance for the deceased in the afterlife.
                                                    These sacrifices, often of camels or sheep, were seen as a means to
                                                    ensure the favour of the departed soul and seek blessings (Peterson,
                                                    1997). Various other rituals, such as placing offerings at graves,
                                                    seeking intercession from the deceased, and holding annual
                                                    commemorative feasts, were also practised (Watt, 1971).</p>

                                                <p>While these practices were prevalent in pre-Islamic Arabia, Islam
                                                    guides on matters related to death and burial. Islam encourages
                                                    individuals to express grief in a dignified manner, without
                                                    excessive wailing or displays of emotion that may be seen as extreme
                                                    or contrary to the teachings of the faith. Animal sacrifices are not
                                                    deemed necessary or encouraged in Islam, as the focus is on prayer,
                                                    remembrance, and acts of charity to honour the deceased.</p>

                                                <p>The veneration of graves and their associated practices have been
                                                    deeply ingrained in human societies throughout history. These
                                                    practices, rooted in cultural, religious, and societal beliefs,
                                                    honour the deceased, maintain a connection with one’s ancestors, and
                                                    seek spiritual solace. While Islam acknowledges the importance of
                                                    honouring the deceased and maintaining a relationship with one’s
                                                    roots, it emphasises the principle of monotheism and encourages
                                                    simplicity in remembrance. Islam guides to ensure that practices
                                                    related to graves and burial align with its core principles and do
                                                    not deviate into idolatry or excessive rituals.</p>

                                                <p>The advent of Islam in the 7th century CE significantly reshaped the
                                                    religious and cultural fabric of the Arabian Peninsula. Prophet
                                                    Muḥammad’s mission was to usher in monotheism while challenging and
                                                    amending the socio-religious practices of the time, many rooted in
                                                    pre-Islamic (Jahiliyya) traditions. The transformation was nuanced,
                                                    involving a subtle amalgamation of abolishing certain customs and
                                                    adapting others into the Islamic fold.</p>

                                                <p>Foremost among these challenges was idol worship. The Ka’ba in Mecca,
                                                    eventually the holiest site in Islam, was once laden with idols.
                                                    This idolatry was rebuked in the Qurʾān:</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">سَيَقُولُ ٱلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُوا۟ لَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ مَآ أَشْرَكْنَا
                                                    وَلَآ ءَابَآؤُنَا وَلَا حَرَّمْنَا مِن شَىْءٍۢ ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ كَذَّبَ
                                                    ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ حَتَّىٰ ذَاقُوا۟ بَأْسَنَا ۗ قُلْ هَلْ
                                                    عِندَكُم مِّنْ عِلْمٍۢ فَتُخْرِجُوهُ لَنَآ ۖ إِن تَتَّبِعُونَ
                                                    إِلَّا ٱلظَّنَّ وَإِنْ أَنتُمْ إِلَّا تَخْرُصُونَ ١٤٨</p>

                                                <p>“Verily! You (O Muḥammad) and those who worship idols are in the same
                                                    claim (in this matter)” (Qurʾān, 6:148).</p>

                                                <p>The conquest of Mecca facilitated the purging of the Ka’ba and the
                                                    instilment of monotheistic practices. While some pre-Islamic
                                                    practices vanished, others integrated into Islam after undergoing
                                                    modifications. For instance, the Hajj pilgrimage, rooted in
                                                    pre-Islamic traditions of the Ishmaelites, was reformed to align
                                                    with monotheistic principles. Additionally, societal norms and
                                                    customs not contradicting Islamic teachings were preserved.</p>

                                                <p>Hadiths, recording Prophet Muḥammad’s sayings and deeds, were pivotal
                                                    in this transformation. They either endorsed, amended, or prohibited
                                                    pre-Islamic practices. His approach was pragmatic, acknowledging the
                                                    deep-seated nature of certain traditions and advocating gradual
                                                    change.</p>

                                                <p>There was resistance, particularly from the Quraysh tribe in Mecca,
                                                    who perceived this transformation as undermining their dominance.
                                                    Nevertheless, Prophet Muḥammad’s strategic and often conciliatory
                                                    approach ensured the eventual ascendancy of Islamic practices.
                                                    Central to this reformation was Tawḥīd, the oneness of God, which
                                                    the Qurʾān fervently emphasised. One such verse is:</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ ١</p>

                                                <p>“Say (O Muḥammad): ‘He is Allāh, (the) One. Allāh-us-Samad (The
                                                    Self-Sufficient). He begets not, nor was He begotten. And there is
                                                    none co-equal or comparable unto Him.'” (Qurʾān, 112:1-4).</p>


                                                <p>This encapsulates the essence of Tawḥīd, delineating God’s unique
                                                    nature and unfathomable essence. Moreover, the Qurʾān firmly
                                                    condemned any form of shirk (associating partners with God):</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِۦ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ
                                                    ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ ۚ وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدِ ٱفْتَرَىٰٓ
                                                    إِثْمًا عَظِيمًا ٤٨</p>

                                                <p>“Verily, Allāh forgives not that partners should be set up with Him
                                                    (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He
                                                    wills.” (Qurʾān, 4:48).</p>

                                                <p>Such teachings deeply influenced Muslim life, from daily prayer
                                                    rituals to broader ethical guidelines. Historically, Tawḥīd acted as
                                                    a revolutionary force, overturning the polytheistic beliefs of
                                                    pre-Islamic Arabia.</p>

                                                <p>While the Qurʾān underscored the principle of Tawḥīd, it did not
                                                    explicitly forbid visiting graves. Indeed, Prophet Muḥammad visited
                                                    the graves of his companions, offering prayers for their souls. Over
                                                    time, visiting the graves of pious individuals became a revered
                                                    practice among Muslims, viewed as a conduit for spiritual blessings.
                                                </p>

                                                <p>However, Ziyāra, or visiting graves, is distinguished from grave
                                                    worship. While the former serves as a reflective reminder of life’s
                                                    ephemerality, the latter, bordering on deification, is prohibited in
                                                    Islam.</p>

                                                <p>The Qurʾān reiterates that true guidance is found not in physical
                                                    markers or relics but in divine revelation. Practices that might
                                                    lead to idolatry or associating partners with Allāh, such as
                                                    venerating heroes to the point of deification, were eschewed.</p>

                                                <p>During the Prophet Muḥammad’s era, the Arabian Peninsula was a
                                                    diverse tapestry of religious beliefs, including paganism, Judaism,
                                                    and Christianity. The Quraysh, Mecca’s prominent tribe, staunchly
                                                    practised polytheism. Meanwhile, Jewish and Christian communities
                                                    flourished in areas like Medina and Najran.</p>

                                                <p>Concerned about the dilution of Islamic traditions, the Prophet
                                                    Muḥammad cautioned Muslims against emulating the religious festivals
                                                    of Jews and Christians. He emphasised the distinct nature of Islamic
                                                    celebrations, notably Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha (Al-Bukhārī, 952).
                                                    The qibla, the direction of Muslim prayer, initially faced Jerusalem
                                                    but was later shifted to the Kaaba in Mecca, reinforcing the
                                                    distinct identity of Islamic worship (Qurʾān, 2:144).</p>

                                                <p>The Prophet consistently warned against blind imitation, particularly
                                                    of practices not rooted in Islamic tenets (Al-Nasā’ī, 5371). The
                                                    Qurʾān, while recognising the validity of earlier scriptures,
                                                    highlights the alterations made by their adherents:</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">۞ أَفَتَطْمَعُونَ أَن يُؤْمِنُوا۟ لَكُمْ وَقَدْ كَانَ فَرِيقٌۭ
                                                    مِّنْهُمْ يَسْمَعُونَ كَلَـٰمَ ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ يُحَرِّفُونَهُۥ مِنۢ
                                                    بَعْدِ مَا عَقَلُوهُ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ ٧٥</p>

                                                <p>“Do you covet that they will believe in your religion when some used
                                                    to change the Word of Allāh knowingly after understanding it?”
                                                    (Qurʾān, 2:75).</p>


                                                <p>Furthermore, it cautions Muslims against mindlessly following the
                                                    majority, who often rely on conjecture rather than truth (Qurʾān,
                                                    6:116). Central to the Prophet Muḥammad’s teachings was preserving
                                                    Islam’s unique identity and purity. While Islam acknowledges all
                                                    prophets and shares Abrahamic lineage with Judaism and Christianity,
                                                    it emphasises maintaining clear religious demarcations.</p>

                                                <p>The Prophet ardently promoted pure monotheistic worship, evident in
                                                    his stance on funerary monuments and the images within the Ka’ba. He
                                                    counselled against constructing opulent tombs, fearing such edifices
                                                    might detract from monotheistic devotion (Muslim, 970). He endorsed
                                                    a minimalist approach to burial, urging for unmarked graves so that
                                                    the deceased were remembered for their actions, not the grandeur of
                                                    their resting places (Al-Bukhārī, 1345).</p>

                                                <p>He advocated visiting graves as reflections on the afterlife and the
                                                    transience of earthly existence (Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim, 977). Upholding the
                                                    ethos of simplicity, he instructed followers on swift and humble
                                                    burials without undue embellishments. Grave monuments were
                                                    discouraged to prevent possible veneration and to ensure the
                                                    unwavering focus on monotheistic worship (Abu Dawood, 3217).</p>

                                                <p>During his visits to graves, the Prophet Muḥammad would supplicate
                                                    for the departed, reinforcing the continuity of the soul’s journey
                                                    and the ties between the living and the deceased (Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim,
                                                    974). He also stressed restraint in mourning, noting that excessive
                                                    grief could lead to despair (Ṣaḥīḥ Al-Bukhārī, 1292).</p>

                                                <p>While the Qurʾān doesn’t detail burial rites per se, it poignantly
                                                    speaks of life’s </p>

                                                    (Qurʾān, 3:185).</p>

                                                <p>The Qurʾān critically assesses pre-Islamic Arabian beliefs,
                                                    spotlighting their widespread idolatry. One verse captures the era’s
                                                    dominant polytheistic sentiments, elucidating Islam’s monumental
                                                    task in promoting monotheism (Qurʾān, 12:106).</p>

                                                <p>The Prophet Muḥammad’s guidance on faith and practice remains
                                                    paramount for Muslims (Qurʾān, 3:31). His teachings, as well as
                                                    those of the Ṣaḥāba and the subsequent generations, illuminate the
                                                    path for Muslims navigating modern complexities. The Prophet’s
                                                    assertion, “The best of people are my generation, then those who
                                                    come after them, then those who come after them” (Al-Bukhārī &
                                                    Muslim, cited in Al-Siba’ī, 2005), accentuates the importance of
                                                    adhering to the practices of the early Muslim community (Ṣaḥīḥ
                                                    Al-Bukhārī, 3650).</p>

                                                <p>The era succeeding the Prophet’s passing is critical for its
                                                    religious precedents, especially regarding grave treatment. The
                                                    Ṣaḥāba offer invaluable insights into authentic Islamic practices
                                                    (Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim, 2533). Notably, ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb, the second
                                                    Caliph, firmly opposed actions leading to shirk (associating
                                                    partners with God) (Ṣaḥīḥ Al-Bukhārī, 1344).</p>

                                                <p>He conveyed his intent to level any elevated grave, emphasising the
                                                    necessity to prevent graves from evolving into worship centres (Ibn
                                                    Sa’d, Kitāb al-Ṭabaqāt al-Kabīr).</p>

                                                <p>‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib, the fourth Caliph and the Prophet’s cousin, also
                                                    echoed this sentiment, always underscoring God’s unity and
                                                    discouraging practices deviating from it (Naḥjul Balāgha, Sermon
                                                    124). Records from this period indicate proactive measures, such as
                                                    demolishing structures over graves, to mitigate excessive
                                                    veneration, a custom prevalent in pre-Islamic Arabia (Ibn Kathīr,
                                                    Al-Bidāya wa’l-Nihāya).</p>

                                                <p>In his Kitāb al-Waṣīla, Ibn Taymiyyah delves into these matters,
                                                    spotlighting the uniform stance of early Muslims on grave rituals.
                                                    He emphasises their unwavering commitment to maintaining the
                                                    sanctity of Tawḥīd (Islamic monotheism) (Qurʾān, 112:1-4).</p>

                                                <p>Islam persistently highlights God’s oneness, warning against idolatry
                                                    (Qurʾān, 4:36). The Qurʾān reiterates monotheism’s significance and
                                                    the dangers of associating partners with Allāh (Qurʾān, 6:151). And,
                                                    while the Qurʾān doesn’t directly prohibit depicting living beings,
                                                    Ḥadīth literature records the Prophet’s disapproval of illustrating
                                                    animate entities, especially in worship precincts (Ṣaḥīh Al-Bukhārī,
                                                    5950).</p>



                                                <p>Iconoclasm has deep roots in Sunni Islam, traceable to early Caliphs,
                                                    particularly during the Umayyad and Abbasid periods (Esposito,
                                                    2002). Caliphs like Yazīd II promulgated decrees for removing images
                                                    from both public and private spheres, fortifying religious orthodoxy
                                                    (Lassner, 1980).</p>

                                                <p>Islam’s extension beyond Arabia prompted exchanges with myriad
                                                    cultures, each introducing its practices and convictions. Such
                                                    interactions instigated shifts in customary Islamic rites, notably
                                                    concerning graves, as the burgeoning Islamic empire in the 7th and
                                                    8th centuries engulfed territories like Persia and Egypt with
                                                    deep-rooted veneration traditions (Hodgson, 1974).</p>

                                                <p>Ṣūfism, intrinsic to Islam, though anchored in its early days,
                                                    matured over epochs. Revered Ṣūfi figures amassed vast
                                                    discipleships. Post-demise, their graves occasionally transformed
                                                    into ziyārat sites (Chittick, 1983). While Ṣūfism focuses on soul
                                                    sanctification and drawing near to Allāh, certain rites within some
                                                    Ṣūfi circles faced scrutiny by traditionalist scholars, particularly
                                                    grave adoration, in his Majmū’ al-Fatāwā, Ibn Taymiyyah spotlighted
                                                    these deviations from early Islamic principles.</p>

                                                <p>Grave worship’s evolution in Islamic history epitomises the nuanced
                                                    interplay of cultural assimilation, theological perspectives, and
                                                    various Islamic movement emergencies. While Islam’s foundational
                                                    tenets remain unwavering, immersing oneself in these historical
                                                    nuances enriches the backdrop for current grave worship discussions
                                                    (Momen, 1987).</p>

                                                <p>The development of various legal schools marks the history of the
                                                    Islamic empire, each interpreting Islamic jurisprudence
                                                    distinctively. While these schools shared agreement on fundamental
                                                    tenets, they often diverged on secondary issues, notably grave
                                                    practices (Hallaq, 2005). The growth of the Islamic empire also
                                                    brought about intricate discussions on grave structures, with
                                                    distinctions between private and public property becoming paramount
                                                    for mausoleum constructions (Mortel, 1993).</p>

                                                <p>As Islam integrated with diverse cultures, certain practices emerged
                                                    that were sometimes viewed as bidʿa by purist scholars, and
                                                    treatises condemning these practices, mainly related to grave
                                                    veneration, proliferated (Lucas, 2002). Muslim dynasties, ranging
                                                    from the Umayyads to the Ottomans, exhibited varying stances towards
                                                    grave visiting (Flood, 2001). Socio-political, cultural, and
                                                    religious elements have largely shaped this spectrum of beliefs,
                                                    practices, and traditions within Islamic history.</p>

                                                <p>The Marwanid era, part of the more extensive Umayyad dynasty, was
                                                    crucial in establishing the Islamic empire. Their approach to
                                                    religious practices like grave veneration was, in part, a strategic
                                                    move to consolidate the diverse Muslim populace, aligned with the
                                                    Qurʾān’s emphasis on unity (Qurʾān, 3:103; Donner, 2010).</p>

                                                <p>Historically, Islamic rulers have employed funeral monuments as
                                                    symbols of piety and political tools (Blair, 1995). The eighth
                                                    century notably saw a societal shift, with campaigns limiting
                                                    women’s roles in funerary practices (Georgelin, 2010).</p>

                                                <p>Comparing Kufa and Medina, we find contrasting traditions in early
                                                    Islamic grave practices. As the Prophet’s city, Medina maintained
                                                    traditions steeped in its unique religious significance (Siddiqui,
                                                    1993). Kufa, however, established as a garrison town and later the
                                                    capital during Ali ibn Abi Talib’s reign cultivated a broader
                                                    spectrum of funerary customs, influenced by its diverse inhabitants
                                                    and early Islamic political significance (Madigan, 2009).</p>

                                                <p>Ibn Ḥanbal, founder of the Ḥanbalī school, profoundly influenced
                                                    Islamic funerary norms. His emphasis on unwavering adherence to the
                                                    Qurʾān and Hadith informed the Ḥanbalī perspective on grave
                                                    practices, advocating simplicity and caution against potential
                                                    innovations (Melchert, 1997; Lucas, 2002).</p>

                                                <p>Throughout the Islamic era, funerary architecture has had dual roles:
                                                    religious commemoration and political strategy. These monuments,
                                                    representing both the ruler’s commitment to Islam and their
                                                    political aspirations, are intertwined with the Qurʾān’s teachings
                                                    on life’s transience (Qurʾān, 16:96; Hillenbrand, 1994). Across
                                                    dynasties, rulers have utilised these structures to intertwine their
                                                    reign with revered religious sites, consolidating power and
                                                    legitimacy (Bloom, 2001).</p>

                                                <p>Imam Abu Ḥanīfa’s burial site is an example of the ironies in grave
                                                    veneration. Though he preached simplicity in burial practices, his
                                                    grave evolved into a pilgrimage site, indicative of the ongoing
                                                    tension between respect for religious figures and potential
                                                    excessive veneration (Makdisi, 1997; Dutton, 2002).</p>

                                                <p>The veneration of graves and relics transcends Islam, with roots in
                                                    other religious traditions like Judaism and Christianity. Judaism,
                                                    strictly monotheistic, has its traditions of grave reverence, while
                                                    Christianity’s stance on religious images has evolved (Schwartz,
                                                    2001; Pelikan, 1974). The Prophet Muḥammad, mindful of these
                                                    practices, advised against emulating them to safeguard Islam’s
                                                    monotheistic core (Ṣaḥīḥ Al-Bukhārī).</p>

                                                <p>The Islamic tradition discerns between grave veneration and honouring
                                                    the awliyā. Grave veneration entails paying respects at graves
                                                    potentially seeking blessings. It can inadvertently elevate the
                                                    deceased to a status reserved for Allah if unchecked. In contrast,
                                                    honouring the awliyā involves drawing inspiration from their pious
                                                    lives, though this too can tread the delicate line between reverence
                                                    and excessive veneration (Qurʾān, 2:163; Tayob, 1999).</p>

                                                <p>At the heart of Islamic tenets is Tawḥīd, a steadfast monotheism
                                                    emphasising the absolute oneness of Allah. With this pillar,
                                                    questions arise around grave-related customs and whether they tilt
                                                    towards shirk (attributing partners to Allah) and bidaʻ. Allah
                                                    condemns associating partners with Him in the Qurʾān:</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِۦ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ
                                                    ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ ۚ وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدِ ٱفْتَرَىٰٓ
                                                    إِثْمًا عَظِيمًا ٤٨</p>

                                                <p>“Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him
                                                    (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He
                                                    wills” (Qurʾān, 4:48).</p>

                                                <p>The Ḥanbalī school, especially under the tutelage of luminaries like
                                                    Imam Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal and Ibn Taymiyyah, has expressed deep
                                                    reservations about grave veneration. These reservations are anchored
                                                    in:</p>

                                                <p>1. Adherence to Ḥadīths highlighting the Prophet Muḥammad’s
                                                    directives against elevating graves.</p>

                                                <p>2. Disapproval of building mausoleums or elaborate shrines over
                                                    graves, fearing these might morph into objects of worship.</p>

                                                <p>3. The belief that frequent visits, especially to graves of
                                                    illustrious personalities, might deviate into practices not
                                                    sanctioned by Islam.</p>

                                                <p>While visiting graves as a memento mori is endorsed in Islam, the
                                                    Qurʾān clarifies the ineffectiveness of anything other than Allah:
                                                </p>

                                                <p>“And those, whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even
                                                    a Qitmīr (the thin membrane over the date-stone)” (Qurʾān, 35:13).
                                                </p>

                                                <p>The perspectives of Ibn Taymiyya are deeply rooted in a strict
                                                    adherence to the Qurʾān and Ḥadīth. His enthusiasm for ensuring
                                                    undiluted monotheism drove him to question customs, especially those
                                                    surrounding graves, that appeared influenced by external traditions,
                                                    thereby straying from core Islamic doctrines.</p>


                                                <p>Yet, when practised with the correct intentions, grave visitation is
                                                    supported in Islamic tradition. As elucidated by the Prophet
                                                    Muḥammad: “I had prohibited you from visiting graves, but now visit
                                                    them for they serve as reminders of the Hereafter” (Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim).
                                                </p>

                                                <p>Ibn Taymiyya’s reservations are primarily centred on the potential
                                                    shirk stemming from excessive adulation at the graves of virtuous
                                                    individuals and introducing practices inconsistent with the Qurʾān
                                                    and Sunnah. He notably expressed concerns about the extensive
                                                    veneration towards the Prophet Muḥammad’s grave in Medina,
                                                    apprehensive that it could verge on idol worship.</p>

                                                <p>Sunni jurisprudence showcases a range of opinions regarding grave
                                                    veneration. The Ḥanafīs, for instance, permit grave visits but
                                                    caution against elaborate rituals (Al-Jassās, 1995). The Mālikīs
                                                    advocate for Qurʾānic recitation at graves (Ibn ʻAbd al-Barr, 2002),
                                                    and the Shāfiʿīs emphasise sincerity of purpose (Al-Nawawī, 1999).
                                                    With their spiritual inclinations, Sufi traditions bring another
                                                    dimension to these views.</p>

                                                <p>Numerous elements, including globalisation and the ascension of
                                                    Salafism, mould contemporary dialogues on grave veneration. While a
                                                    segment pushes for revisiting ‘pristine’ practices, others champion
                                                    adaptability in light of the multifaceted realities of Muslim
                                                    societies (Nasr, 2004).</p>

                                                <p>The Qurʾān and Ḥadīth serve as the bedrock, but the ensuing
                                                    interpretations over millennia have nuanced the discourse on grave
                                                    veneration in Islam. This highlights the criticality of upholding
                                                    the sanctity of Tawḥīd, guiding believers to discern between genuine
                                                    reverence and overstepping into unwarranted adoration. Grave worship
                                                    and its legitimacy within the Islamic framework has been a topic of
                                                    contention for centuries. Orthodox Islamic teachings are categorical
                                                    in cautioning against practices that verge on shirk. However,
                                                    certain sections within the Muslim community defend specific
                                                    grave-related practices. Unpacking these arguments and
                                                    counterarguments sheds light on the intricacies of this discourse.

                                                <p>Arguments Advocated by Proponents of Grave Worship</p>

                                                <p>1. Intercession (Tawassul): A prevailing argument posits that
                                                    visiting graves and soliciting the intercession of the deceased,
                                                    notably saints or righteous figures, aids in spiritual proximity to
                                                    Allah. Given their devout lives, such figures are deemed capable of
                                                    interceding for the living.</p>

                                                <p>2. Closeness to the Deceased: For some, proximity to the grave of a
                                                    pious individual or a loved one fosters a dual closeness to both the
                                                    deceased and Allah. They perceive the grave as a spiritual bridge.
                                                </p>

                                                <p>3. Spiritual Experiences: Personal spiritual encounters, such as
                                                    visions or profound peace during grave visits, justify grave
                                                    veneration.</p>

                                                <p>Counterarguments Derived from Islamic Scriptures and Traditions</p>

                                                <p>1. Intercession (Tawassul): While Islam acknowledges the principle of
                                                    intercession, it delineates clear parameters. A hadith from Ṣaḥīḥ
                                                    Muslim underscores that intercession lies solely with Allah, as the
                                                    Prophet Muḥammad remarked, “Who among you can intercede with Him
                                                    except by His Permission?”. This implies that irrespective of the
                                                    piety of the deceased, intercession’s ultimate authority resides
                                                    only with Allah.</p>

                                                <p>2. Closeness to the Deceased: Gaining inspiration from the virtuous
                                                    lives of the deceased is laudable. However, it’s vital to segregate
                                                    this admiration from seeking barakah (blessings) directly from their
                                                    graves. The Prophet Muḥammad endorsed grave visits as reminders of
                                                    mortality and the Hereafter, not as a medium to garner blessings
                                                    from the departed.</p>

                                                <p>3. Spiritual Experiences: The Quran and the Sunnah of the Prophet are
                                                    the bedrock of Islamic practice. Individual spiritual revelations,
                                                    albeit profound, should not dictate or establish religious
                                                    conventions. Given their subjective nature and susceptibility to
                                                    various influences, personal emotions and experiences are unreliable
                                                    yardsticks for defining religious practices.</p>

                                                <p>While the rationale for grave worship often stems from personal
                                                    spiritual and emotional experiences, orthodox Islamic tenets stress
                                                    the importance of authentic sources. Soliciting intercession,
                                                    blessings, or aid from entities other than Allah is perceived as a
                                                    digression from Tawḥīd, the foundational monotheistic principle in
                                                    Islam.</p>


                                                <p>In conclusion, grave worship is a phenomenon wherein the deceased are
                                                    venerated or sought for intercession, poses a serious threat to
                                                    Islam’s pure monotheistic creed. The Qur’ān, Sunnah, and the
                                                    consensus of classical Islamic scholars serve as evidence against
                                                    such practices. Allāh warns against setting up partners with Him:
                                                </p>

                                                <p class="arabic">إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِۦ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ
                                                    ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ ۚ وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدِ ٱفْتَرَىٰٓ
                                                    إِثْمًا عَظِيمًا ٤٨</p>

                                                <p>“Verily, Allāh does not forgive that partners should be set up with
                                                    Him in worship, but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom
                                                    He pleases” (Qur’ān 4:48).</p>

                                                <p>The Prophet Muhammad said: “Beware! Those before you used to take the
                                                    graves of their prophets and righteous men as places of worship, but
                                                    you must not take graves as mosques; I forbid you to do that.”
                                                    (Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim, 532).</p>

                                                <p>Ibn al-Qayyim opined the dangers of grave worship in his work Kitāb
                                                    al-Ṣalat. He stated that such acts divert one’s devotion from Allāh
                                                    to the creation, which is a clear deviation from tawḥīd.</p>

                                                <p>Ibn Taymiyyah, in his book Iqtiḍaʾ al-Ṣirāṭ al-Mustaqīm, extensively
                                                    discussed the prohibition of constructing mosques over graves,
                                                    citing it as an innovation (bidʿa) and a step towards shirk.</p>

                                                <p>Grave worship, while appearing pious to some, is a perilous route
                                                    leading away from the teachings of Islam. Its origins can be traced
                                                    to pre-Islamic practices, where graves and idols were venerated.
                                                    Furthermore, external influences from neighbouring cultures and
                                                    religions have also seeped into Muslim practices over time. Finally,
                                                    in their quest for legitimacy and public approval, certain
                                                    governments have encouraged or disregarded such acts, seeing them as
                                                    a means to appease and control the masses.</p>
