                                                <p>Since the beginning of time, Allāh has sent revelations to chosen
                                                    individuals. These revelations primarily address two aspects of
                                                    personal life that impact human beings: their relationships with the
                                                    Creator and the society in which they reside. For instance, the Ten
                                                    Commandments commence with the commandments of faith:</p>

                                                <p>“I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the
                                                    land of slavery:</p>
                                                <p>1. “You shall have no other gods before me.”</p>
                                                <p>2. “You shall not make yourself a carved image or any likeness of
                                                    anything in heaven above, in the earth beneath, or the water under
                                                    the earth. You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I the
                                                    Lord your God are only worthy of worship, visiting the iniquity of
                                                    the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation
                                                    of those who hate me, but showing steadfast love to thousands of
                                                    those who love me and keep my commandments…” (Exodus 20: 1-17).</p>

                                                <p>Similarly, Prophet Muḥammad periodically received Qurʾānic
                                                    revelations concerning prayer, worship, conduct, etc. It is
                                                    essential to remember that messengers and prophets were also human
                                                    beings; despite their interactions with the divine, they lived as
                                                    ordinary individuals, possessing the same human characteristics we
                                                    all share, and were susceptible to mistakes and errors like everyone
                                                    else. Nonetheless, Allāh, exalted be He, safeguarded them from major
                                                    sins and ensured they conveyed the revelations accurately.</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">قُلْ إِنَّمَآ أَنَا۠ بَشَرٌۭ مِّثْلُكُمْ يُوحَىٰٓ

                                                <p>“Say (O Muhammad): “I am only a man like you. It has been inspired to
                                                    me that your Ilah (God) is One Ilah (God, i.e., Allah). So, whoever
                                                    hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and
                                                    associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord”.</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">شَهِدَ ٱللَّهُ أَنَّهُۥ لَآ إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ

                                                    do wrong could see when they will see the torment, that all power
                                                    belongs to Allah and that Allah is Severe in punishment”</p>

                                                <p>The first revelation and call were also the central pillar of Islam.
                                                    The Messenger (PBUH) told the people, “Say O’ people — There is no
                                                    God but Allāh and take Success” (Musnad Aḥmad, 4: 341).</p>

                                                <p>However, over time the central call of the Prophet has become
                                                    misunderstood by some people who use the Shahādatayn and seek to
                                                    include Muḥammad as His slave and Messenger in divinity with Allāh.
                                                    For this reason, we will explore the Shahāda. The Shahāda, as
                                                    proclaimed in the Qurʾān, is “shahida Allāh ʾanahu lā ʾilāha ʾillā
                                                    huwa…” (transl. God bears witness that there is no god but Him). All
                                                    other extensions of the Shahāda involve statements of belief that
                                                    stem from the original, such as faith in messengers, angels,
                                                    scriptures, heaven and Hell, the Day of Judgement, and destiny.
                                                    There is debate on when the phrase “Muḥammad is the messenger of
                                                    God” was incorporated into the Shahāda. Some contend that this
                                                    phrase was revealed as part of the Shahādatayn from the inception of
                                                    Islam, while others suggest it was added later. This aligns with
                                                    earlier Abrahamic traditions, which prioritise the worship of God
                                                    alone over prophets, such as “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the
                                                    Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all
                                                    your soul and with all your strength” (Deuteronomy 6: 4-5).</p>

                                                <p>The fluidity of Islamic identity during the formative period of Islam
                                                    indicates similar flexibility in expressing the Shahāda. In this
                                                    initial phase, the Shahāda consisted of the phrase “There is no god
                                                    but God” or “There is no god but God, He alone with no associates”.
                                                    In the second stage, the Shahāda transitioned to the more popular
                                                    “double” form recognised today, the Shahādatayn: “There is no god
                                                    but God, and Muḥammad is the messenger of God.” This shift was
                                                    driven by an increased emphasis on Muḥammad and the Qurʾān within
                                                    the community of believers. The Qurʾān does not mention the
                                                    Shahādatayn explicitly. Instead, it says the two components
                                                    individually:</p>

                                                    Ever All-Aware of everything” (Q. 33:40).</p>

                                                <p>The initial phase of Muḥammad’s prophethood was towards his family
                                                    and the Makkah. These initial calls were to accept one God, the
                                                    universal truth given to all prophets. While the Makkans denied
                                                    Muḥammad’s prophethood, their core criticism was the unification of
                                                    worship to one God.</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">أَجَعَلَ ٱلْـَٔالِهَةَ إِلَـٰهًۭا وَٰحِدًا ۖ إِنَّ

                                                    Verily, this is a curious thing! (Q. 38:5).</p>

                                                <p>During this period, the Shahāda entered around denying other gods and
                                                    their being any entity worthy of worship. After Muḥammad immigrated
                                                    to Madina, the prophet encountered the Jewish community. During this
                                                    period, revelation centred around reminding the Jewish people about
                                                    the Religion of Abraham.</p>

                                                    acknowledging Muḥammad as a messenger became quintessential to being
                                                    on the Abrahamic path. The final stage follows the conquest of

                                                    This verse of the Qurʾān is the closest to the Shahādatayn in the
                                                    Qurʾān “so believe in God and His Messenger,” followed by the direct
                                                    command to “follow him so that you may find guidance”. These
                                                    sentiments are echoed in verses which command the believers to “Obey
                                                    God, obey the Messenger” (Q. 4:59; 5:92; 24:52; 24:54).

                                                    The earliest recorded instances of the phrases constituting the
                                                    Shahāda can be found in coins and architectural designs dating back
                                                    to the late seventh century. This implies that the Shahāda was not a
                                                    widely recognised or formalised statement of faith during that
                                                    period. One version of the Shahāda reads, “There is no deity but God
                                                    alone; He has no partner with Him; Muḥammad is the Messenger of
                                                    God”, appearing in an inscription on the Dome of the Rock in
                                                    Jerusalem (constructed in 692 CE). Another variant, “Muḥammad is the
                                                    Servant of God and His messenger”, can be seen on coins minted
                                                    during the reign of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, the fifth Umayyad
                                                    caliph.

                                                    While it is not clear exactly when the Shahāda became widely used
                                                    among Muslims, it is evident that the beliefs it embodies were
                                                    present in the Qurʾān and Islamic theology from its early history.
                                                    Throughout formative Islam, Muslims utilised various Shahādas. For
                                                    Instance, Abū Ḥanīfa’s Fiqh al-Akbar, has the Shahāda as “to state.
                                                    I believe in Allāh, His Angels, His Scriptures, His messengers,
                                                    resurrection after death, qadr, good and evil being from Allāh the
                                                    Highest, the reckoning, the scale, Paradise, and Hellfire”. In the
                                                    early creedal text reported by ibn Abī Ḥātim al-Razī (from his
                                                    Father), he states, ‘Imān is speech and action” In the narration of
                                                    Ibn Abī Dunyā, Abū Ḥātim al-Razī reports the Shahāda as being “there
                                                    is no deity worthy of worship except God”. The seminal theological
                                                    tract ʾAqīda al-Ṭaḥāwīya opens with “Allāh is one without any
                                                    partner” and only proceeds to mention the prophethood of Muḥammad 28
                                                    points later. Furthermore, based on numismatic evidence, we find the
                                                    early Muslims using various Shahāda, for instance, ʿAbd al-Malik ibn
                                                    ʿAbd Allāh’s dirhams 685 CE include the phrase “bismi Allāh Muḥammad
                                                    Rasūl Allāh”.” In contrast, in variant coins adapted from the
                                                    Sasanian coins read “bismi Allāh lā ʾilāha illā Allāh waḥdahu
                                                    Muḥammad Rasūl Allāh”, another variant is found in the dome of the
                                                    rock which reads, “bismi Allāh alRaḥmān al-Raḥīm lā ʾilāha illā
                                                    Allāh waḥdahu lā sharīka lahu Muḥammad Rasūl Allāh”. Additionally,
                                                    we find variants owning to sectarian reasons; Bishr ibn Marwan’s
                                                    coins only contain the phrase “bismi Allāh Muḥammad Rasūl Allāh”.
                                                    The exclusion of “lā ʾilāha illā” was to avoid similarities with the
                                                    Kharijite formula “lā ḥukm illā li-llāh”. What follows then is that
                                                    Muslims recognised the dynamism of Muslim identity; the Shahāda was
                                                    dynamic and contextual, and the Qurʾān and ḥadīth express the whole
                                                    formation as it is used today; however, this usage was to establish
                                                    Islam’s universality and Muḥammad’s messengership. Once this was
                                                    found, the de facto Shahāda was “there is no deity worthy of worship
                                                    except God”, which was embodied by necessity belief in the Qurʾān,
                                                    and other articles of faith as outlined in Abū Ḥanīfa’s Shahāda.

                                                    role, the prophet Muḥammad is not special or unique compared to the
                                                    other prophets. However, he is the carrier of God’s law which
                                                    clarifies and abrogates what came before it, and he recited and

                                                    to follow. It is in caution of this relevance that the prophet
                                                    warned us, “Do not exalt me as the Christians have exalted the son

                                                    superiority over other prophets, but like them, he was honoured with
                                                    stations. However, it is not because of these unique characteristics
                                                    that we love or keep the prophet. Instead, this is done out of the

                                                <p>
                                                    “Say: “O you mankind! Now truth (i.e., the Qur’an and Prophet
                                                    Muhammad) has come to you from your Lord. So, whosoever receives
                                                    guidance, he does so for the good of his own self, and whosoever
                                                    goes astray, he does so to his own loss, and I am not (set) over you
                                                    as a Wakil (disposer of affairs to oblige you for guidance)” (Q.
                                                    10:108).
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    In drawing this examination to a close, the Shahādatayn was not the
                                                    initial call of the Prophet. Instead, the inaugural message was “lā
                                                    ʾilāha illā Allāh”. The recognition of Prophet Muḥammad as a
                                                    divinely appointed messenger became imperative when confronted with
                                                    disbelievers, and those from preceding revelations who refused to
                                                    acknowledge his prophethood, i.e., communities such as Christians
                                                    and Jews, acknowledged the maxim “lā ʾilāha illā Allāh”. Still, they
                                                    rejected the Qurʾān, primarily out of pride and prejudice against
                                                    Muḥammad’s Arab heritage. Consequently, “Muḥammadan ʾAbduhu wa
                                                    Rasullahu” became part of the testament of faith. Thus, the
                                                    Shahādatayn, far from elevating the Prophet to a status equivalent
                                                    to Allāh, instead serves to amplify and extend “lā ʾilāha illā
                                                    Allāh”. It is a critical delineation separating those who embrace
                                                    Allāh’s message to humanity from those who, through arrogance or
                                                    bigotry, reject it.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    This distinction should never be misconstrued as asserting equality
                                                    between Allāh and the Prophet. It is wholly inappropriate to conjoin
                                                    Allāh and Muḥammad casually. Instead, we must heed the precise
                                                    language utilised by Allāh and His Messenger, which often presents
                                                    the following formulations: “Allāh and His messenger” or “Allāh and
                                                    His slave and messenger”. The prophet’s companions established this
                                                    point and clarified the role of the prophet after his demise; Ibn
                                                    Abbas reported: that Abū Bakr went to the mosque door when he heard
                                                    the news of the prophet’s passing. Abū Bakr said, “To proceed:
                                                    Whoever among you worships Muḥammad, peace and blessings be upon
                                                    him, then Muḥammad has died. Whoever worships Allāh, then Allāh is
                                                    alive and cannot die. Allāh Almighty said, “Muhammad is no more than
                                                    a Messenger, and indeed (many) Messengers have passed away before
                                                    him. If he dies or is killed, will you then turn back on your heels
                                                    (as disbelievers)? And he who turns back on his heels, not the least
                                                    harm will he do to Allah, and Allah will give reward to those who
                                                    are grateful” (Q. 3:144). Ibn Abbas said, “By Allāh, it was as if
                                                    the people had not known that Allāh revealed this verse until Abū
                                                    Bakr recited it” (Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī 1241). In an alternate
                                                    narration, Abū Bakr also recited, “You [Prophet] will certainly die,
                                                    and so will they” (Q 39:40; Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī 3667; 3668). Thus, the
                                                    usage of the Shahādatayn must be prefaced with a clear understanding
                                                    of tawḥīd, Allāh is the priority of every Muslim, and no one is
                                                    included with him in any sense, such that it dilutes His greatness.
                                                    The Shahādatayn is used to establish the Qurʾān and other articles
                                                    of faith; once this is achieved, we return to lā ʾilāha illā Allāh.
