                                                    intricacies of our environment, His magnificence is evident. Our
                                                    innate curiosity, wonder, quest for meaning and purpose, and pursuit
                                                    of knowledge and understanding guide us towards Him. However, the
                                                    most profound means to truly know Allāh is by immersing ourselves in
                                                    His divine discourse as enshrined in the Qurʾān. By scrutinising

                                                    His actions as manifested in events and behaviours, we can truly

                                                    Allāh. As Ibn Qudama states, understanding and believing in these
                                                    attributes is essential for a Muslim’s faith.109 They enable us to

                                                    example, when reflecting upon Allāh as AlRahman (The Most Merciful)
                                                    and Al-Rahim (The Most Compassionate), a believer is reminded of the

                                                    (The Accepter of Repentance), a Muslim is encouraged to seek Allāh’s

                                                    sense of humility and awe in the hearts of believers. As they grasp

                                                    dependence on Him. This sentiment is echoed by Imam Shafiʻi, who
                                                    said, “Knowledge of Allāh’s attributes increases the fear of Allāh
                                                    and brings the servant closer to Him”. 117

                                                    highlights the importance of reflecting on Allāh’s attributes in our

                                                    the early Muslims laid out. In outlining this methodology, we must
                                                    first understand some fundamental principles which arise when
                                                    discussing the attributes.

                                                    Tawḥīd implies that God is the only worthy object of worship, best
                                                    exemplified in the Qurʾānic statement, “There is no deity but God”.
                                                    124 It is worth noting that while tashbīh (likeness) and tanzīh
                                                    (transcendence) are inherently linked to tawḥīd, only the latter is
                                                    appropriately a feature of it. Tanzīh is used positively, while
                                                    tashbīh always carries the negative connotations of tajsim
                                                    (anthropomorphism). Tawḥīd entails that the various attributes that
                                                    predicate God are distinct, and for God alone, the creation sharing
                                                    in these is, at best metaphorical. To share in the predication of an
                                                    attribute is where tashbīh and tanzīh mark their difference; tashbīh
                                                    denotes similarities or likenesses entailing tajsim. At the same
                                                    time, tanzīh denotes a distinctness and uniqueness in God’s
                                                    attributes.

                                                    found in the methodology of the early generations of Muslims; This
                                                    approach is known as the Atharī School of theology and has taken its
                                                    name due to the position of only understanding ṢifātAllāh based
                                                    upon narrations (Athar). The school’s claimants state the Atharī
                                                    creed is the creed of the ṣaḥāba (companions); the earliest
                                                    reference point of codification is Aḥmad bin Ḥanbal. 125 The Atharī
                                                    school was later espoused by scholars such as Ibn Qudama and Ibn
                                                    Taymiyya. This approach adheres to a straightforward and literal
                                                    approach to understanding the divine attributes, based on the
                                                    principle of “accepting the texts as they are” without delving into
                                                    their metaphysical implications. 126 In doing so, one avoids ta’wīl
                                                    (allegorical interpretation) and tafwīḍ (consigning the meaning to
                                                    Allāh), as these may lead to distortions of the original meanings.

                                                    This should not be confused with a literal affirmation of Allāh’s
                                                    attributes which would be anthropomorphism; instead, it is an

                                                    anthropomorphism, as it maintains the transcendence and uniqueness
                                                    of Allāh, who is “nothing like unto Him”. 128

                                                    For example, when the Qurʾān speaks of Allāh’s “Hand” or “Face”, the
                                                    Atharī school does not interpret these attributes in a literal,
                                                    human-like manner.129 Rather, it affirms their existence without
                                                    describing their modality or comparing them to human
                                                    characteristics. As Imam Aḥmad states, “We affirm what Allāh has
                                                    affirmed for Himself… without delving into how or likening Him to
                                                    His creation”. 130 This understanding is clearly echoed in the

                                                    deeply into the nature of the divine attributes, supporting the

                                                    favours”. 133 The Ṣaḥāba also reiterated this position, Ibn ʿAbbās,
                                                    said: “Allāh is described as He described Himself without asking
                                                    how”. 134 Renowned scholars have also affirmed the Atharī approach
                                                    to understanding the names and attributes of Allāh: Imam Malik
                                                    stated: “Allāh’s Istiwā (ascension) over the Throne is known, its
                                                    modality is unknown, belief in it is obligatory, and questioning it
                                                    is an innovation”. 135 Ibn Taymiyya: “We affirm what Allāh has
                                                    affirmed for Himself or what His Messenger has affirmed for Him,

                                                    By examining these sources, it becomes evident that the Atharī
                                                    school’s approach to understanding the names and attributes of Allāh
                                                    is deeply rooted in the Qurʾān, Ḥadīth, and the sayings of the
                                                    Ṣaḥāba, Salaf, and renowned scholars

                                                    The Atharī school critiques the Kalām theologians and Muslim
                                                    philosophers for their overemphasis on rationality and speculative
                                                    theology, which can lead to the denial or distortion of specific
                                                    divine attributes. For example, al-Ghazali leans towards allegorical
                                                    interpretation and argues for metaphorically understanding some of
                                                    Allāh’s attributes. 139 This approach can lead to an incorrect
                                                    understanding of the divine attributes and undermine the simplicity
                                                    and clarity of the original texts. The different understandings of
                                                    Allāh between the Atharī, Ashʿarī and Mu’tazilī schools are based on
                                                    their perceptions of tawḥīd. Each school has developed formulae to
                                                    understand Ṣifāt-Allāh. However, these formulae are constricted. For
                                                    example, if we consider the āyāt “…O Iblīs, what prevented you from
                                                    prostrating to that which I created with My hands…”. 140 The Atharī
                                                    school takes the position of affirming the attribute of a hand and
                                                    the literal meaning, without tashbīḥ (likeness) or tamthīl
                                                    (comparison) to humanity, negating knowledge of the kafiyya
                                                    (reality). The Ashʿarī school affirms the attribute. However, it
                                                    negates knowledge of its meaning and reality and, in turn,
                                                    interprets the attribute to mean power. However, the Mu’tazali
                                                    school rejects the meaning of Yad (hand); the Mu’tazali position is
                                                    Ta’wīl (interpretation), meaning either God’s Essence or Grace.141
                                                    The verse indicates the uniqueness of Adam’s creation, namely being
                                                    created by Allāh’s hands. We find inconsistency within the theology
                                                    Ashʿarī school when discussing other ṢifātAllāh. When talking about
                                                    Ṣifāt al-ḏhāt, such as knowledge, the Ash’aris confirm Allāh’s
                                                    knowledge just as the Atharī school does. i.e., Allāh’s knowledge is
                                                    an affirmed attribute, and the word al-‘Alīm (All-Knowing) is
                                                    understood in its literal usage, and the reality is in a way that
                                                    suits Allāh’s Majesty without tashbīḥ or tamthīl. However, the
                                                    Mu’tazilīs state that Allāh’s knowledge is not independent, eternal
                                                    knowledge. Instead, His Knowledge is Himself.

                                                    were heavily influenced by Greek philosophy, particularly the works
                                                    of Aristotle and Plato. While they attempted to harmonise Islamic
                                                    theology with Greek thought, this often resulted in the

                                                    Sunnah in understanding the nature of Allāh’s relationship with
                                                    creation rather than adopting foreign philosophical ideas.144 Muslim
                                                    philosophers strongly emphasised intellect and reason as the primary
                                                    means of acquiring knowledge and understanding the divine. While

                                                    Imam Abu Ḥanīfa emphasised that reason should be used in harmony

                                                    The relationship between Muslim philosophers and Kalām theologians
                                                    is complex and multifaceted. While both groups aimed to understand
                                                    and articulate Islamic theology, their methodologies and sources of
                                                    influence often differed. Despite these differences, there were
                                                    instances where the works of Muslim philosophers had a significant
                                                    impact on the development of Kalām theology. Muslim philosophers and
                                                    Kalām theologians were both parts of the broader intellectual
                                                    tradition in the Islamic world. They shared a common goal of seeking
                                                    knowledge and understanding the divine, sometimes leading to
                                                    cross-pollination of ideas between the two groups. Muslim
                                                    philosophers and Kalām theologians employed reason, logic, and
                                                    argumentation in their pursuit of knowledge, although to varying
                                                    degrees and with different emphases

                                                    Muslim philosophers, as mentioned earlier, were heavily influenced
                                                    by Greek philosophy, especially the works of Aristotle and Plato.
                                                    Kalām theologians, on the other hand, were initially more focused on
                                                    addressing theological disputes within the Islamic community.
                                                    However, as they encountered the works of Muslim philosophers and
                                                    their Greek sources, some Kalām theologians also began to adopt and
                                                    adapt Greek philosophical concepts and methods in their work. For
                                                    example, the Mu’tazila, a prominent Kalām theological school, was
                                                    influenced by Greek philosophy in developing their rationalist
                                                    approach to Islamic theology. They sought to establish the unity and
                                                    justice of Allāh through rational arguments and borrowed concepts
                                                    from Greek philosophy, such as the distinction between essence and
                                                    attributes.146

                                                    Throughout Islamic history, there were instances of debates and
                                                    dialogues between Muslim philosophers and Kalām theologians. These
                                                    interactions allowed for an exchange of ideas and arguments, often
                                                    leading to the refinement of their respective positions. For
                                                    instance, AlGhazali, a notable Kalām theologian, engaged with the
                                                    works of Muslim philosophers like Ibn Sina and Al-Fārābī in his book
                                                    Tahafut al-Falāsifa. In this work, he critiqued their

                                                    positions on various theological and philosophical issues, leading
                                                    to a more robust understanding of Islamic theology.

                                                    In some cases, Kalām theologians sought to synthesise and integrate
                                                    the insights of Muslim philosophers into their theological
                                                    frameworks. One notable example is the Ashʿarī school of Kalām
                                                    theology, founded by Al-Ash’aris, which incorporated elements of the
                                                    rationalist Mu’tazila approach and the teachings of Muslim
                                                    philosophers. Al-Ashʿarī, in his work AlLuma’ (The Sparks),
                                                    demonstrates the influence of Muslim philosophers by incorporating
                                                    philosophical concepts, such as the distinction between the
                                                    necessary, the possible, and the impossible, in his theological

                                                    The relationship between Muslim philosophers and Kalām theologians
                                                    is characterised by shared intellectual traditions and the influence
                                                    of one group on the other. While they had distinct methodologies and
                                                    sources of influence, the interaction between Muslim philosophers
                                                    and Kalām theologians allowed for a dynamic and fruitful exchange of
                                                    ideas that enriched the Islamic intellectual tradition. The Kalām
                                                    theologians and Muslim philosophers often use allegorical
                                                    interpretations of the divine attributes to reconcile them with
                                                    their rationalist and philosophical frameworks. This approach can
                                                    lead to distortions and misrepresentations of the original meanings.
                                                    For instance, Al-Ghazali, in his book Al-Iqtisād fi al-I’tiqad,
                                                    argues for the metaphorical understanding of some of Allāh’s
                                                    attributes, such as His “Hand” and “Face.” However, this approach is
                                                    inconsistent with the teachings of the Prophet Muḥammad, who said,
                                                    “Reflect upon the creation of Allāh, but do not reflect upon the
                                                    essence of Allāh”. 148

                                                <p class="content-paragraph">
                                                    Some Kalām theologians deny specific divine attributes to maintain
                                                    the philosophical idea of divine simplicity. This approach
                                                    contradicts the Qurʾān and the Sunnah, which explicitly affirm these
                                                    attributes. As Allāh states in the Qurʾān: “And to Allāh belong the
                                                    best names, so invoke Him by them”. 149 Ibn Abbas emphasised the
                                                    importance of accepting the divine attributes as they are mentioned
                                                    in the Qurʾān, saying, “Allāh is described as He described Himself
                                                    without asking how”. 150 Kalām theologians and Muslim philosophers
                                                    often prioritise



                                                    rational arguments over textual evidence, leading to potential
                                                    conflicts with the Qurʾān and Ḥadīth. This approach contrasts
                                                    Salaf’s methodology, which emphasises the primacy of revelation. Ibn
                                                    Taymiyya criticised this approach, stating that the use of rational
                                                    arguments should never undermine the apparent meanings of the Qurʾān
                                                    and Ḥadīth. 151 Similarly, Imam Aḥmad warned against engaging in
                                                    speculative theology. 152

                                                    the names and attributes of Allāh constitute vital conduits through

                                                    This profound verse underscores the inescapable intimacy that exists
                                                    between Allāh and His creation. By engendering a profound awareness
                                                    of Allāh’s attributes, we become acutely cognisant that our
                                                    dependence lies not with any other entity; Allāh is limitless,
                                                    ever-awake, possesses infinite wealth, and is eternally existent. As

                                                    reverence for idols, or other transient entities. The infinite
                                                    bounties and mercy of Allāh are sufficient for us. This sentiment is

                                                    Therefore, our spiritual compass should continually guide us towards
                                                    this unwavering truth – our reliance upon and devotion to Allāh
                                                    alone. In doing so, we foster a relationship of deepseated faith
                                                    and understanding, which culminates in the realisation of His
                                                    all-encompassing sufficiency and guidance in our lives. An enriched
                                                    comprehension of Allāh and His attributes infuses our lives with
                                                    tranquillity and joy, a consequence of realising that we are under
                                                    the aegis of an omnipotent Lord who cherishes us. As our
                                                    deliberations have highlighted, Allāh’s uniqueness transcends any of
                                                    His creations; no entity, be it human, Prophet, or angel, can stake
                                                    a claim to His names or attributes. Equating Him with any of His
                                                    creations amounts to Shirk, the act of polytheism, and
                                                    anthropomorphism.

                                                <p class="content-paragraph">
                                                    However, it must be acknowledged that His attributes, while beyond
                                                    our full comprehension, can be grasped at a fundamental level. This
                                                    rudimentary understanding suffices in facilitating the cultivation
                                                    of a meaningful bond with the Most High. It allows us to appreciate
                                                    His majesty without crossing the sacred threshold into the realm of
                                                    equating His divine attributes with His creations. This nuanced
                                                    understanding is vital in maintaining the sanctity of Tawḥīd, which
                                                    forms the cornerstone of our faith. Thus, as we journey towards a
                                                    deeper connection with Allāh, let us do so with reverence, humility,
                                                    and a profound respect for His incomparable nature.
