                                            </h4>

                                            <div>
                                                <p>Linguistically, al-Dunyā carries the meaning of “lower,” “nearest,”
                                                    or “nearer.” In the context of the Qurʾān, al-Dunyā is utilised 115
                                                    times, primarily denoting the temporal and spatial existence of
                                                    human beings in this world (Wehr, 1961). The concept of al-Dunyā is
                                                    introduced in the Qurʾān with Q. 2:201, which says,</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">وَمِنْهُم مَّن يَقُولُ رَبَّنَآ ءَاتِنَا فِى
                                                    ٱلدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةًۭ وَفِى ٱلْـَٔاخِرَةِ حَسَنَةًۭ وَقِنَا عَذَابَ
                                                    ٱلنَّارِ ٢٠١</p>

                                                <p>“And of them, there are some who say: ‘Our Lord! Give us in this
                                                    world that which is good and in the Hereafter that which is good,
                                                    and save us from the torment of the Fire!'”</p>

                                                <p>This verse outlines a dual request from the faithful: to receive good
                                                    in al-Dunya, this world, and the Hereafter. It is imperative to note
                                                    the encompassing use of “that which is good,” affirming the
                                                    potentiality for worldly life to harbour virtuous experiences and
                                                    not exclusively serve as a place of tribulation or sinful
                                                    indulgence.</p>

                                                <p>Similar sentiments of seeking good in al-Dunyā appear in multiple
                                                    Qurʾānic verses, such as Q. 5:33; 7:156; 9:69; 16:30; 27:29. For
                                                    instance, Q. 16:30 interprets the recompense of the ones who do good
                                                    as “…’Enter Paradise, you and your wives, in happiness.’ Trays of
                                                    gold and cups will be passed round them, (there will be) all that
                                                    inner-selves could desire, all that eyes could delight in, and you
                                                    will abide therein forever”. This verse amplifies the Qurʾān’s
                                                    inclination to acknowledge the intrinsic good present in the world,
                                                    painting a picture of al-Dunyā that is not inherently evil or
                                                    corrupt but laden with opportunities for righteous conduct and
                                                    blessings.</p>

                                                <p>Furthermore, the Qurʾān emphasises the value of this world as a means
                                                    to gain merit for the Hereafter. For instance, Q.18:46 illustrates
                                                    this point:</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">ٱلْمَالُ وَٱلْبَنُونَ زِينَةُ ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا ۖ
                                                    وَٱلْبَـٰقِيَـٰتُ ٱلصَّـٰلِحَـٰتُ خَيْرٌ عِندَ رَبِّكَ ثَوَابًۭا
                                                    وَخَيْرٌ أَمَلًۭا ٤٦</p>

                                                <p>“Wealth and children are the adornment of the life of this world. But
                                                    the good, righteous deeds (five compulsory prayers, deeds of Allah’s
                                                    obedience, good and nice talk, remembrance of Allah with
                                                    glorification, praises and thanks, etc.), that last, are better with
                                                    your Lord for rewards and better in respect of hope”.</p>

                                                <p>The verse suggests that worldly possessions, such as wealth and
                                                    children, have their rightful place and value in al-Dunyā, but the
                                                    righteous deeds, primarily accomplished in this world, hold eternal
                                                    weight. The concept of al-Dunyā is thus not limited to the material
                                                    world and its ephemeral nature, but it includes time spent in this
                                                    world, moral choices, actions, experiences, and more. In al-Dunyā,
                                                    the believer finds the arena for the struggle towards goodness,
                                                    righteousness, and fulfilment of the divine mandate. This worldly
                                                    life provides the opportunity to amass spiritual wealth that could
                                                    benefit the soul in the Hereafter.</p>

                                                <p>Hence, the Qurʾānic conception of al-Dunyā strays away from an
                                                    absolutist and inherently negative perspective. Instead, it
                                                    introduces a nuanced understanding of where this world can be a
                                                    place of trials and triumphs, hardships and ease, and righteousness
                                                    and transgression. The believers are encouraged to seek the good in
                                                    this world, not shun it. This is tied into a broader Qurʾānic theme
                                                    of balance, which necessitates an equilibrium between one’s
                                                    spiritual duties and worldly endeavours. As the Qurʾān indicates in
                                                    Q. 28:77,</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">وَٱبْتَغِ فِيمَآ ءَاتَىٰكَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلدَّارَ
                                                    ٱلْـَٔاخِرَةَ ۖ وَلَا تَنسَ نَصِيبَكَ مِنَ ٱلدُّنْيَا ۖ وَأَحْسِن
                                                    كَمَآ أَحْسَنَ ٱللَّهُ إِلَيْكَ ۖ وَلَا تَبْغِ ٱلْفَسَادَ فِى

                                                <p>“But seek, with that (wealth) which Allah has bestowed on you, the
                                                    home of the Hereafter, and forget not your portion of legal
                                                    enjoyment in this world, and do good as Allah has been good to you,
                                                    and seek not mischief in the land. Verily, Allah likes not the
                                                    Mufsidun (those who commit great crimes and sins, oppressors,
                                                    tyrants, mischief-makers, corrupts)”.</p>

                                                <p>A common misunderstanding often arises when interpreting the term
                                                    al-Dunyā within Islamic discourse. Misconceptions frequently revolve
                                                    around the idea that al-Dunyā is portrayed negatively within the
                                                    Qurʾān, leading to a perception that it is a realm to be shunned or
                                                    avoided by the faithful. Such a viewpoint, however, oversimplifies
                                                    the nuanced Qurʾānic concept of al-Dunyā and disregards the text’s
                                                    multifaceted and complex understanding of worldly life.</p>

                                                <p>The primary root of this misunderstanding could be traced back to the
                                                    selective reading of certain Qurʾānic verses that seem to depreciate
                                                    the world’s value. An example can be found in Q. 6:32,</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">وَمَا ٱلْحَيَوٰةُ ٱلدُّنْيَآ إِلَّا لَعِبٌۭ وَلَهْوٌۭ
                                                    ۖ وَلَلدَّارُ ٱلْـَٔاخِرَةُ خَيْرٌۭ لِّلَّذِينَ يَتَّقُونَ ۗ أَفَلَا
                                                    تَعْقِلُونَ ٣٢</p>

                                                <p>“And the life of this world is nothing but play and amusement. But
                                                    far better is the house in the Hereafter for those who are
                                                    Al-Muttaqun (the pious). Will you not then understand?”.</p>

                                                <p>At first glance, this verse might denigrate worldly life by comparing
                                                    it to ‘play and amusement’. However, carefully reading this verse
                                                    reveals that it is not negating the world’s worth but rather
                                                    questioning an attitude that treats it solely as an arena of
                                                    frivolity and hedonistic pursuits; this leads us to a significant
                                                    consideration: the Qurʾān, in its depictions of al-Dunyā, frequently
                                                    distinguishes between the world as a place of existence and the
                                                    worldly life infused with unchecked materialism and moral decadence.
                                                    The Qurʾān often criticises the latter, cautioning the believers
                                                    against becoming overly engrossed in worldly pleasures to neglecting
                                                    their spiritual obligations and the Hereafter.</p>

                                                <p>A good example to illustrate this point is Q. 57:20,</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">ٱعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّمَا ٱلْحَيَوٰةُ ٱلدُّنْيَا لَعِبٌۭ

                                                <p>“Know that the life of this world is only play and amusement, pomp

                                                    believers, good-doers), whereas the life of this world is only a
                                                    deceiving enjoyment”.
                                                </p>
                                              
                                                <p>Such verses critique the unchecked pursuit of worldly gains,
                                                    imploring individuals not to lose sight of their ultimate purpose
                                                    and destiny in the Hereafter. However, it is crucial to stress that
                                                    such verses are not advocating asceticism or total abandonment of
                                                    worldly pursuits. Instead, they serve as a reminder of the relative
                                                    value of worldly life compared to eternal life. They stress the
                                                    importance of maintaining a healthy balance between worldly
                                                    responsibilities and spiritual obligations.</p>

                                                <p>Al-Ḥayāt al-Dunyā is replete with moral challenges, tests, and
                                                    temptations. Such depictions primarily serve as cautionary advice,
                                                    reminding believers about the transient nature of worldly life and
                                                    urging them not to succumb to its enticements at the expense of
                                                    their eternal spiritual well-being. Each individual is continually
                                                    confronted with choices between righteousness and transgression,
                                                    which bear consequences in this life and the hereafter. As outlined
                                                    in Q. 2:155,</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">وَلَنَبْلُوَنَّكُم بِشَىْءٍۢ مِّنَ ٱلْخَوْفِ وَٱلْجُوعِ وَنَقْصٍۢ

                                                <p>“And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a

                                                    patient”.</p>

                                                <p>One of the most potent verses in the Qurʾān that succinctly
                                                    encapsulates the transient nature of al-Ḥayāt al-Dunyā is Q. 3:185:
                                                </p>

                                                <p class="arabic">كُلُّ نَفْسٍۢ ذَآئِقَةُ ٱلْمَوْتِ ۗ وَإِنَّمَا تُوَفَّوْنَ
                                                    أُجُورَكُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَـٰمَةِ ۖ فَمَن زُحْزِحَ عَنِ ٱلنَّارِ
                                                    وَأُدْخِلَ ٱلْجَنَّةَ فَقَدْ فَازَ ۗ وَمَا ٱلْحَيَوٰةُ ٱلدُّنْيَآ
                                                    إِلَّا مَتَـٰعُ ٱلْغُرُورِ ١٨٥</p>

                                                <p>“Every soul shall taste death. And you will be paid in full only on
                                                    the Day of Resurrection. So whoever is removed away from the Fire
                                                    and admitted to Paradise, indeed, he is successful. The life of this
                                                    world is only the enjoyment of deception”.</p>

                                                <p>The verse begins with an assertion of life’s inescapable reality:
                                                    death. In asserting that “Every soul shall taste death,” the verse
                                                    emphatically reminds us of our mortality, a universal truth often
                                                    forgotten or overlooked in the hustle and bustle of worldly life.
                                                    The word ‘taste’ here emphasises the personal and intimate
                                                    experience of death, which every individual will inevitably
                                                    encounter (Tafsir Ibn Kathir).</p>

                                                <p>Moreover, the verse highlights the belief in the Day of Resurrection,
                                                    stating that the full recompense of our deeds will only occur in the
                                                    Hereafter. This assertion imparts a profound moral dimension to
                                                    human life, with every action bearing potential eternal
                                                    consequences. It underscores the notion that this worldly life is a
                                                    period of testing and trial, the results of which will manifest in
                                                    the future.</p>

                                                <p>Next, the verse outlines the fundamental success criterion, i.e.,
                                                    salvation from Hellfire and admission into Paradise. Success in
                                                    Islam, as it emerges from this verse, is not tied to worldly
                                                    achievements, wealth, or status but is inherently spiritual and
                                                    eternal. The fleeting achievements of this world pale in comparison
                                                    to the everlasting bliss of the Hereafter, thus encouraging
                                                    individuals to strive for moral and spiritual excellence.</p>

                                                <p>Finally, the verse characterises al-Ḥayāt al-Dunyā as ‘enjoyment of
                                                    deception’. The Arabic phrase, ‘matāʿul ghurūr’, captures worldly
                                                    life’s illusory and deceptive nature. ‘Matā’ signifies something
                                                    used for a temporary period, further emphasising the transitory
                                                    aspect of this life. ‘Ghurūr’, often translated as ‘deception’,
                                                    connotes a sense of illusion, delusion, or vanity (Wehr, 1961). This
                                                    characterisation cautions against becoming unduly attached to or
                                                    enamoured by the material world’s allurements.</p>

                                                <p>The portrayal of the world as a deceptive enjoyment underscores the
                                                    Qurʾānic view of the inherent tension between life’s material and
                                                    spiritual dimensions. It is a tension that invites introspection and
                                                    serves as a continual reminder of the importance of striking a
                                                    balanced approach towards life, embracing the world to attain
                                                    spiritual ends rather than an end in itself.</p>

                                                <p>In contextualising the verse within the broader Qurʾānic narrative,
                                                    it is apparent that Q. 3:185 offers a profound critique of
                                                    materialistic tendencies and a call towards spiritual and moral
                                                    transcendence. While it cautions against excessive attachment to the
                                                    material world, it does not promote asceticism or world denial.
                                                    Instead, it advocates for a balanced and purposeful engagement with
                                                    the world, where material resources are utilised for spiritual
                                                    growth, service to humanity, and seeking the pleasure of the Divine.
                                                    The Qurʾān acknowledges the natural human inclination towards
                                                    worldly comforts and pleasures. As stated in Q. 3:14,</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">زُيِّنَ لِلنَّاسِ حُبُّ ٱلشَّهَوَٰتِ مِنَ ٱلنِّسَآءِ وَٱلْبَنِينَ

                                                    ٱلْمَـَٔابِ ١٤</p>

                                                <p>“Beautified for people is the love of that which they desire – of
                                                    women and sons, heaped-up sums of gold and silver, fine branded
                                                    horses, and cattle and tilled land”.</p>

                                                <p>This verse encapsulates the various dimensions of human desires:
                                                    familial (women and sons), wealth (heaped-up sums of gold and
                                                    silver), status (fine branded horses, an indicator of wealth and
                                                    status in the Arab context), and means of livelihood (cattle and
                                                    tilled land). The Qurʾān recognises these desires, portraying them
                                                    as inherent aspects of the human experience.</p>

                                                <p>However, the Qurʾān warns about the dangers of excessive attachment
                                                    to these worldly goods and pleasures. Q. 57:20 describes life as a
                                                    “play and a (passing) delight. Decoration, boasting among you, and
                                                    rivalry regarding wealth and children is the likeness of vegetation
                                                    after rain”. Here, the verse vividly illustrates worldly life’s
                                                    transient and fleeting nature, cautioning individuals against
                                                    becoming unduly consumed by worldly pursuits at the expense of
                                                    eternal matters.</p>

                                                <p>These Qurʾānic verses do not negate or demean the pursuit of worldly
                                                    comforts and joys; instead, they provide a critical framework within
                                                    which these pursuits should occur. The Qurʾān discourages a
                                                    materialistic perspective that views life solely regarding worldly
                                                    gains, devoid of spiritual and moral considerations. In contrast to
                                                    these portrayals, the Qurʾān presents models of individuals who,
                                                    while they partake of the bounties of this world, do not lose sight
                                                    of the Hereafter. A notable example is found in Q. 2:201, wherein it
                                                    is said:</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">وَمِنْهُم مَّن يَقُولُ رَبَّنَآ ءَاتِنَا فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةًۭ
                                                    وَفِى ٱلْـَٔاخِرَةِ حَسَنَةًۭ وَقِنَا عَذَابَ ٱلنَّارِ ٢٠١</p>

                                                <p>“And among them are those who say, ‘Our Lord, give us in this world
                                                    [that which is] good and in the Hereafter [that which is] good, and
                                                    protect us from the punishment of the Fire'”.</p>

                                                <p>This verse outlines an ideal approach to life, seeking a balance
                                                    between worldly well-being and spiritual success. The verse’s
                                                    phrasing suggests a holistic conception of ‘good’ that encompasses
                                                    material and spiritual aspects. It indicates a desire for worldly
                                                    blessings that do not compromise one’s prospects in the Hereafter.
                                                    Additionally, the plea for protection from the Fire points to an
                                                    awareness of the consequences of one’s actions and a longing for
                                                    God’s mercy, a characteristic feature of the Qurʾānic portrayal of
                                                    the pious believer.</p>

                                                <p>Therefore, the Qurʾān’s portrayal of desires for this world should
                                                    not be understood as a blanket condemnation of worldly pursuits or
                                                    an encouragement towards world denial. Instead, the Qurʾān advocates
                                                    for a balanced approach, wherein one can partake of the world’s
                                                    bounties without being ensnared by them. </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    The Qurʾān is replete with verses that illuminate the transient
                                                    nature of human life on Earth, thus cultivating an enduring
                                                    perception of temporariness. The emphasis on the fleeting quality of
                                                    life and the material world (al-Dunyā) serves as a reminder of our
                                                    mortality and a guide for aligning our worldly actions with eternal
                                                    consequences. The Qurʾānic portrayal of the temporariness of life
                                                    begins with the creation of man itself. In Q. 31:34,
                                                </p>
                                                <p class="arabic">

                                                <p>
                                                    “Knowledge of the Hour [of Resurrection] belongs to God; it is He
                                                    who sends down the relieving rain and He who knows what is hidden in
                                                    the womb. No soul knows what it will reap tomorrow, and no soul
                                                    knows in what land it will die; it is God who is all-knowing and all
                                                    aware”.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    The Qurʾān affirms that knowledge of the hour (the end of the
                                                    world), one’s lifespan, and future occurrences are known only to
                                                    God. It underlines human existence’s transient and unpredictable
                                                    nature and God’s ultimate knowledge and control.

                                                <p>
                                                    However, the Qurʾānic emphasis on life’s temporariness is not to
                                                    induce pessimism but to encourage believers to reorient their lives
                                                    towards the eternal – the Hereafter. This spiritual recalibration is
                                                    not meant to negate the importance of worldly life but to balance
                                                    the pursuit of worldly achievements with the striving for success in
                                                    the life to come. Q. 28:77 underscores this balance, encouraging
                                                    believers to seek this world’s good while not forgetting their share
                                                    of the Hereafter. The Qurʾān validates the pursuit of a wholesome
                                                    life in the world and categorically rejects asceticism. When the
                                                    followers of Jesus Christ asked him whether to be ascetics, Jesus
                                                    (peace be upon him) responded, as mentioned in the Qurʾān, that God
                                                    did not prescribe monasticism for them in Q. 57:27:

                                                    “We sent other messengers to follow in their footsteps. After those,
                                                    We sent Jesus, son of Mary: We gave him the Gospel and put
                                                    compassion and mercy into the hearts of his followers. But
                                                    monasticism was something they invented- We did not ordain it for
                                                    them- only to seek God’s pleasure, and even so, they did not observe
                                                    it properly. So We gave a reward to those who believed, but many of
                                                    them were lawbreakers.”
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    This reflects the view, as articulated by Izutsu (2002), that “the
                                                    Qurʾān sees in the earthly life of man a meaningful episode of his
                                                    eternal journey”. However, it must be emphasised that the Qurʾān
                                                    encourages responsible enjoyment of the world, free from excess and
                                                    waste. For example, it admonishes those who squander their wealth
                                                    (Q.. 17:26) and those who are excessively attached to the material
                                                    world (Q 102:1-2). These verses aim to foster a sense of stewardship
                                                    towards material resources and mindfulness of one’s spiritual
                                                    duties.

                                                    Another aspect of the Qurʾān’s balanced approach to life is the
                                                    emphasis on individual and communal responsibilities. While it
                                                    stresses personal piety and righteousness (Q. 91:7-10), it equally
                                                    underscores the importance of societal obligations, such as the
                                                    pursuit of justice (Q. 4:135), compassion (Q. 90:17), and mutual
                                                    consultation (Q. 42:38).

                                                    Several scholars have explored the Qurʾān’s balanced approach to
                                                    life. Nasr (1993) proposes that the Qurʾān’s approach harmonises the
                                                    vertical dimension of existence (human relationship with the divine)
                                                    with the horizontal dimension (interpersonal relationships and the
                                                    natural world). Hassan (2006), on the other hand, views this balance
                                                    as an equilibrium between the rights of the individual and the
                                                    rights of the community, between the material and spiritual needs,
                                                    and between this world and the hereafter.

                                                <p>
                                                    The Qurʾān presents a nuanced view of the material world,
                                                    acknowledging its potential for spiritual enhancement and moral
                                                    degradation. It encourages believers to avail themselves of the
                                                    Dunyā opportunities while remaining acutely aware of their ultimate
                                                    end. This delicate equilibrium is the central theme of the Qurʾānic
                                                    narrative and contributes to the holistic and balanced view of life.
                                                    The Qurʾān considers the Dunyā a testing ground for human beings. In
                                                    Q. 67:2, it is stated:

                                                <p class="arabic">
                                                    ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ ٱلْمَوْتَ وَٱلْحَيَوٰةَ لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ

                                                    “who created death and life to test you [people] and reveal which of
                                                    you does best––He is the Mighty, the Forgiving”.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Human actions, intentions, and moral choices are tested in this
                                                    world. The Dunyā thus presents an array of opportunities for
                                                    believers to prove their faith and commitment to God’s commandments.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    However, in this engagement with the Dunyā, the Qurʾān consistently
                                                    reminds believers of their ultimate end. Q 3:185 provides a stark
                                                    reminder: “Every soul shall taste of death. And you will be paid on
                                                    the Day of Resurrection only that which you have fairly earned.
                                                    Whoso is removed from the Fire and is made to enter Paradise, he
                                                    indeed is triumphant. The life of this world is but the comfort of
                                                    illusion”.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    The believer, thus, is encouraged to utilise the opportunities in
                                                    the Dunyā in ways that secure success in the ultimate end. For
                                                    example, the Qurʾān commends wealth accumulation as long as it is
                                                    gained through lawful means and used for righteous ends (Q 2:188;
                                                    2:275). It validates the pursuit of knowledge (Q 39:9), encourages
                                                    social and community work (Q 9:71), and promotes justice (Q 4:135),
                                                    all of which can be seen as opportunities for spiritual elevation in
                                                    the Dunyā.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Several scholars have highlighted this balance. Sardar (2012) notes
                                                    that the Qurʾānic view of life necessitates a simultaneous
                                                    engagement with the Dunyā and a consciousness of the ākhira.
                                                    Esposito (2005) argues that the Qurʾān’s perspective enables a
                                                    believer to live “in the world, but not of the world”.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Despite these opportunities, the Qurʾān warns against being overly
                                                    attached to the Dunyā, as it can lead to neglect of spiritual
                                                    responsibilities. This theme is evident in verses such as Q. 57:20,
                                                    which describes the life of this world as play and amusement, and Q.
                                                    102:1-2, which speaks of worldly competition distracting people
                                                    until they visit their graves (Khan, 1997). These verses highlight
                                                    the pitfalls of excessive attachment to the Dunyā and underscore the
                                                    importance of conscious engagement with the world.

                                                <p>
                                                    The Qurʾān, while acknowledging the Dunyā as a place of test and
                                                    opportunity, also frequently cautions against the risks of becoming
                                                    overly consumed by it. This intense entanglement with the material
                                                    world can obstruct spiritual growth and derail believers from their
                                                    ultimate purpose of existence.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    The Qurʾān underscores that overindulgence in the material aspects
                                                    of the Dunyā could lead to neglecting one’s spiritual
                                                    responsibilities and ultimate purpose. This theme is recurrent
                                                    throughout the Qurʾān as a stark reminder of the ephemeral nature of
                                                    the material world and the eternal reality of the ākhira. As Q 3:185
                                                    expresses: “And indeed, the home of the Hereafter – that is the
                                                    life, if only they knew” (Khan, 1997).

                                                    Noteworthy is Q. 57:20, where the Qurʾān describes the Dunyā as
                                                    “play and amusement, pomp and mutual boasting among you, and rivalry
                                                    in respect of wealth and children”. The verse encapsulates how
                                                    individuals can become entrapped in pursuing material success,
                                                    power, and social recognition, leading to a competitive mindset that
                                                    distracts from their spiritual obligations. The same cautionary note
                                                    is echoed in Q. 102:1-2:
                                                </p>
                                                <p class="arabic">

                                                    This verse succinctly captures the human propensity to become
                                                    preoccupied with worldly accumulation, often to the point where
                                                    death—the ultimate reality and the commencement of the
                                                    ākhira—arrives unexpectedly, leaving individuals unprepared for
                                                    their eternal journey.

                                                    Elucidating these verses, the exegesis of classical scholars such as
                                                    al-Tabari and al-Qurṭubī underscores that the Qurʾān does not
                                                    condemn the Dunyā or its enjoyment per se but criticises the
                                                    excessive attachment to it at the expense of the ākhira (al-Tabari;
                                                    al-Qurṭubī). This distinction is crucial to understand the Qurʾān’s
                                                    balanced approach towards worldly life.

                                                <p>
                                                    Modern scholarship corroborates this understanding. Sardar (2012)
                                                    posits that the Qurʾān’s warning against becoming overly consumed by
                                                    the Dunyā is not an indictment of worldly pleasure but a call to
                                                    maintain a balance between material success and spiritual growth.
                                                    Nasr (1996), meanwhile, argues that this Qurʾānic caution serves to
                                                    remind humans of their ultimate purpose: to worship God and seek His
                                                    pleasure rather than being lost in the fleeting amusements of the
                                                    world.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    The risks associated with excessive engrossment in the Dunyā are
                                                    manifold, encompassing both spiritual and psychological aspects.
                                                    Overattachment to the material world can lead to spiritual
                                                    stagnation, diverting attention from God and the ultimate purpose of
                                                    existence. From a psychological perspective, the relentless pursuit
                                                    of worldly success often breeds stress, anxiety, and
                                                    dissatisfaction, a phenomenon supported by extensive research in
                                                    positive psychology (Seligman, 2011).

                                                    In the labyrinthine tapestry of Qurʾānic guidance, it becomes
                                                    manifest that the relationship between humans and wealth is a
                                                    central concern. The Qurʾān’s discourse on wealth, as observed in
                                                    various passages, serves both as a mirror reflecting humankind’s
                                                    inclinations and as a compass directing them towards righteous
                                                    actions. Wealth, although often seen as a marker of worldly success,
                                                    is systematically deconstructed in the Qurʾān, revealing its
                                                    transient nature and its divine origin. Let us delve deeper into
                                                    this theme, through the lens of selected verses, scrutinising the
                                                    Qurʾānic caution against the hoarding of wealth.

                                                <p>
                                                    “Who is he that will lend to Allāh a goodly loan so that He may
                                                    multiply it to him many times? And it is Allāh that decreases or
                                                    increases (your provisions), and unto Him you shall return” (Q.
                                                    2:245).
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    This verse, while ostensibly an invitation to charitable giving, is
                                                    a sharp critique of a mindset that views wealth accumulation as an
                                                    end in itself. By invoking the imagery of lending to God, the Qurʾān
                                                    stresses that what one amasses is neither the result of one’s
                                                    singular endeavour nor is it truly theirs. It is a transient trust,
                                                    its real value lying not in hoarding but in its distribution for the
                                                    greater good.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    And there is no creature on earth but that upon Allāh is its
                                                    provision, and He knows its place of dwelling and place of storage.
                                                    All is in a clear register” (Q. 11:6).
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Hoarding wealth is fundamentally at odds with the divine principle
                                                    outlined here. All provisions come from Allāh, and by extension,
                                                    hording suggests a lack of trust in Allāh’s continuous sustenance.
                                                    It is a stark reminder that wealth is not a result of one’s sole
                                                    efforts or brilliance, but a grace from the Almighty.

                                                <p>
                                                    And spend (in charity) of that with which We have provided you,
                                                    before death comes to one of you and he says: ‘My Lord! If only You
                                                    would give me respite for a little while (i.e. return to the worldly
                                                    life), then I should give Sadaqa (i.e. Zakāt) of my wealth, and be
                                                    among the righteous'” (Q. 63:10).

                                                <p>
                                                    The transience of life is juxtaposed with the human tendency to
                                                    delay charitable deeds. By hoarding wealth, one is in essence
                                                    delaying the very acts that could elevate their spiritual status in
                                                    the Hereafter.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Wealth and children are the adornment of the life of this world. But
                                                    the good righteous deeds (five compulsory prayers, deeds of Allāh’s
                                                    obedience, good and nice talk, remembrance of Allāh with
                                                    glorification, praises and thanks, etc.), that last, are better with
                                                    your Lord for rewards and better in respect of hope” (Q. 18:46).

                                                <p>
                                                    Wealth, when hoarded, is but a fleeting adornment. It pales in
                                                    comparison to righteous deeds, which are eternal. This verse is a
                                                    compelling critique of societies that equate wealth with success,
                                                    challenging this worldview and redirecting the believer’s gaze
                                                    towards eternity.

                                                    whoever puts his trust in Allāh, then He will suffice him. Verily,
                                                    Allāh will accomplish his purpose. Indeed, Allāh has set a measure
                                                    for all things” (Q. 65:3).

                                                    To hoard is to fear scarcity, but this verse extols the boundless
                                                    generosity of Allāh. It critiques the mindset of accumulation as a
                                                    buffer against uncertain futures, reiterating that true security
                                                    lies in divine providence.

                                                    Within the wider context of our discussion on the Dunyā, the Qurʾān
                                                    offers a clear perspective on wealth. It is not to be vilified, nor
                                                    is its pursuit intrinsically corrupt. However, when amassed at the
                                                    expense of societal welfare and spiritual elevation, it becomes a
                                                    grave liability.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    In concluding this intricate exploration of the Qurʾānic concepts of
                                                    al-Dunyā, it becomes evident that these notions provide a profound
                                                    and nuanced understanding of human existence. The Qurʾān, through
                                                    various verses, lays out a comprehensive and balanced approach to
                                                    life that recognises the significance of worldly existence and the
                                                    afterlife while maintaining a tension that encourages moral conduct
                                                    and spiritual development.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    As discussed, the term al-Dunyā encapsulates the totality of human
                                                    life on earth, from mundane activities to the grand scheme of human
                                                    civilisation. However, as highlighted through various verses of the
                                                    Qurʾān, the Dunyā is characterised by its temporariness,
                                                    fleetingness, and potential to engender trials and temptations for
                                                    the believer. In this vein, the Dunyā serves as a moral testing
                                                    ground, presenting opportunities for growth and risks of moral
                                                    decay.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Simultaneously, the Qurʾān’s portrayal of the Dunyā does not
                                                    subscribe to a purely ascetic worldview. Instead, it recognises the
                                                    validity of material pursuits and the enjoyment of worldly bounties
                                                    as long as they are aligned with moral and ethical conduct. Such an
                                                    understanding dispels the common misunderstanding of the Qurʾānic
                                                    term al-Dunyā as purely pejorative, suggesting a more complex and
                                                    nuanced perspective that aligns with the multifaceted human
                                                    experience.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    On the other hand, the term al-ākhira signifies everlasting life
                                                    beyond death, a realm of eternal consequence where the outcomes of
                                                    earthly actions are manifested. The Qurʾān persistently underscores
                                                    the ākhira’s paramount importance, framing it as the ultimate
                                                    destination and the superior life. Such an emphasis serves as a
                                                    powerful reminder of the finite nature of worldly existence and the
                                                    infinite implications of our conduct within it.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    The analysis of the Qurʾānic verses revealed a balanced approach to
                                                    life, one that encourages making the most out of the opportunities
                                                    presented in the Dunyā while remaining acutely aware of the ākhira.
                                                    Such an approach prevents the dangers of becoming excessively
                                                    engrossed in the material aspects of life at the cost of spiritual
                                                    fulfilment and the ultimate purpose of existence.

                                                    The portrayal of al-Dunyā and al-ākhira within the Qurʾān thus
                                                    reflects a profound understanding of the human condition, one that
                                                    acknowledges the realities and challenges of earthly life while
                                                    emphasising the eternal implications of our actions. It is an
                                                    outlook that encourages a balanced pursuit of material and spiritual
                                                    fulfilment, promoting a sense of purpose and moral responsibility
                                                    underpinned by the awareness of a transient world and an everlasting
                                                    hereafter.

                                                    In closing, this discussion underlines the Qurʾān’s profound
                                                    philosophical and ethical insights into the human condition. It
                                                    illustrates how its teachings offer relevant guidance for modern
                                                    societies grappling with the tensions between material success,
                                                    ethical conduct, and spiritual fulfilment.

                                            In the Qurʾān, the concept of al-Dunyā, often translated as “the world,” is presented with a nuanced understanding that goes beyond a simplistic portrayal of worldly life as inherently harmful or to be shunned. While recognising human beings’ temporal and spatial existence in this world, the Qurʾān emphasises the potential for virtuous experiences and righteous conduct in al-Dunyā.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
The Qurʾān repeatedly highlights the importance of seeking good in al-Dunyā, with verses such as Q. 2:201 and Q. 5:33, among others, emphasising the desire for good in this world and the Hereafter. These verses affirm that al-Dunyā is not solely a place of tribulation or sinful indulgence but rather an arena for the struggle towards goodness, righteousness, and the fulfilment of divine mandates.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, the Qurʾān emphasises the value of this world as a means to gain merit for the Hereafter. Verses like Q. 18:46 emphasise the superiority of righteous deeds over worldly possessions, highlighting the eternal weight of moral choices and actions accomplished in this world. Al-Dunyā, therefore, encompasses not just the material world and its ephemeral nature but also includes time spent in this world, moral choices, actions, experiences, and more. It is in al-Dunyā that believers have the opportunity to amass spiritual wealth that could benefit the soul in the Hereafter.
</p>
<p>
Contrary to misconceptions, the Qurʾān does not portray al-Dunyā as a realm to be entirely shunned or avoided by the faithful. Instead, it encourages believers to live in and engage with the world, using it to seek God’s pleasure and prepare for the Hereafter. The Qurʾān promotes a balanced approach to worldly life, advocating for an equilibrium between spiritual duties and worldly endeavours.
</p>
<p>
Misunderstandings about al-Dunyā often arise from selective readings of certain Qurʾānic verses that seem to depreciate the world’s value. For example, Q. 6:32 and Q. 57:20 compare worldly life to “play and amusement” and criticise unchecked materialism. However, a careful reading reveals that these verses critique an attitude that treats earthly life solely as a venue for frivolity, hedonism, and neglect of spiritual obligations. The Qurʾān distinguishes between the world as a place of existence and the worldly life infused with materialism and moral decadence. It cautions against becoming overly engrossed in worldly pleasures to the neglect of spiritual obligations and the Hereafter. 
</p>
<p>
Another aspect of al-Dunyā that is often misunderstood is its linguistic interpretation. Derived from the Arabic root ‘d-n-w’, al-Dunyā means “lower” or “nearer,” indicating immediacy and accessibility. It points to al-Dunyā’s role as the immediate platform for human actions and moral choices, shaping the believer’s destiny in the Hereafter. This linguistic interpretation challenges the notion of al-Dunyā as a purely negative realm to be transcended, highlighting its significance as a place of moral agency and spiritual growth.
</p>
<p>
Within the Qurʾān, numerous verses encourage believers to seek out God’s blessings and enjoy the permissible pleasures of the world. For example, Q. 2:29 and Q. 7:32 emphasise the Divine creation of resources on Earth for the benefit of human beings and the permissibility of enjoying them within the ethical and moral parameters set by Islamic law. These verses establish a balanced and constructive approach towards al-Dunyā, promoting the idea that worldly resources are not shunned but instead utilised responsibly for selfbetterment and enjoyment
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, the Qurʾān presents a comprehensive and balanced view of al-Dunyā, recognising its temporary nature and potential pitfalls and acknowledging its role as a platform for moral agency, spiritual growth, and pursuing God’s pleasure. It encourages believers to engage responsibly with the material world, seeking goodness and balance in their spiritual and worldly endeavours. By understanding the nuanced Qurʾānic concept of al-Dunyā, misconceptions can be countered, and a holistic and purposeful approach to earthly life can be embraced.
