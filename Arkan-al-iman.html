                                            </h4>

                                            <div>
                                                <p>Arkān al-Īmān, or the Pillars of Faith, constitute the fundamental
                                                    beliefs in Islam; this comprehensive set of beliefs, consisting of
                                                    six key elements, shapes a life’s spiritual, ethical, and social
                                                    dimensions (Esposito, 2002, p. 3). Arkān al-Īmān encompasses belief
                                                    in Allāh, His angels, His divine books, His Messengers, the Day of
                                                    Judgment, and predestination (Al-Qadr). Imān, in Arabic, derives
                                                    from the root verb ‘amana,’ which means to feel safe or secure.
                                                    Therefore, the term īmān denotes an internal state of certainty and
                                                    tranquillity derived from accepting Allāh and His commands (Lane,
                                                    1984, p. 2266). It is a profound emotional and intellectual
                                                    conviction, forming a framework through which We perceive and
                                                    interpret reality.</p>

                                                <p>The first and foremost pillar of īmān is the belief in Allāh; His
                                                    existence, His divine unity (tawhīd), His divine attributes, and
                                                    that He is the Creator and Sustainer of the universe. These beliefs
                                                    are enshrined in the Qurʾān, which repeatedly emphasises Allāh’s
                                                    unity, for example,</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ ١ ٱللَّهُ ٱلصَّمَدُ ٢ لَمْ
                                                    يَلِدْ وَلَمْ
                                                    يُولَدْ ٣ وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُۥ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌۢ ٤</p>

                                                <p>“Say: He is Allāh, the One and Only; Allāh, the Eternal, Absolute; He
                                                    begetteth not, nor is He begotten; And there is none like unto Him.”
                                                    (Q. 112:1-4).</p>

                                                <p>The second pillar involves the belief in angels (malā’ikah).
                                                    According to Islamic theology, angels are created from light and are
                                                    assigned various duties in the universe (Nasr, 2003, p. 77). The
                                                    Qurʾān mentions several angels by name, such as Gabriel (Jibrīl) and
                                                    Michael (Mīkāl), underscoring their significant roles in divine
                                                    revelation and the functioning of the cosmos (Q. 2:97-98).</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">قُلْ مَن كَانَ عَدُوًّۭا لِّجِبْرِيلَ فَإِنَّهُۥ
                                                    نَزَّلَهُۥ عَلَىٰ
                                                    قَلْبِكَ بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ مُصَدِّقًۭا لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ
                                                    وَهُدًۭى وَبُشْرَىٰ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ ٩٧ مَن كَانَ عَدُوًّۭا لِّلَّهِ
                                                    وَمَلَـٰٓئِكَتِهِۦ وَرُسُلِهِۦ وَجِبْرِيلَ وَمِيكَىٰلَ فَإِنَّ
                                                    ٱللَّهَ عَدُوٌّۭ لِّلْكَـٰفِرِينَ ٩٨</p>

                                                <p>“Say [Prophet], ‘If anyone is an enemy of Gabriel- who by God’s leave
                                                    brought down the Quran to your heart confirming previous scriptures
                                                    as a guide and good news for the faithful- if anyone is an enemy of
                                                    God, His angels and His messengers, of Gabriel and Michael, then God
                                                    is certainly the enemy of such disbelievers.’ ” (Q. 2:97-98).</p>

                                                <p>The third pillar represents the belief in the divine books (kutub)
                                                    that Allāh revealed as guidance to humanity. We believe in all
                                                    scriptures sent down to the Prophets, including the Torah, the
                                                    Psalms, the Gospel, and the Qurʾān. The Qurʾān, being the final
                                                    revelation, confirms the truths of the previous scriptures and
                                                    corrects any distortions that have occurred over time (Ali, 2003, p.
                                                    35).</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">وَأَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ بِٱلْحَقِّ

                                                    وَٰحِدَةًۭ وَلَـٰكِن لِّيَبْلُوَكُمْ فِى مَآ ءَاتَىٰكُمْ ۖ
                                                    فَٱسْتَبِقُوا۟ ٱلْخَيْرَٰتِ ۚ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ مَرْجِعُكُمْ جَمِيعًۭا

                                                <p>“To you, We sent the Scripture in truth, confirming the scripture
                                                    that came before it, and guarding it in safety” (Q. 5:48).</p>

                                                <p>The fourth pillar revolves around belief in the messengers (rusul) of
                                                    Allāh. We believe that Allāh conveyed His message to humanity
                                                    through chosen individuals, known as Prophets, starting from Adam
                                                    and culminating in Muhammad. These Prophets guided their communities
                                                    and delivered Allāh’s message,</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">يَـٰٓأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَـٰبِ قَدْ جَآءَكُمْ رَسُولُنَا
                                                    يُبَيِّنُ لَكُمْ
                                                    عَلَىٰ فَتْرَةٍۢ مِّنَ ٱلرُّسُلِ أَن تَقُولُوا۟ مَا جَآءَنَا مِنۢ
                                                    بَشِيرٍۢ وَلَا نَذِيرٍۢ ۖ فَقَدْ جَآءَكُم بَشِيرٌۭ وَنَذِيرٌۭ ۗ
                                                    وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍۢ قَدِيرٌۭ ١٩</p>

                                                <p>“People of the Book, Our Messenger comes to you now, after a break in
                                                    the sequence of messengers, to make things clear for you in case you
                                                    should say, ‘No one has come to give us good news or to warn us.’ So
                                                    someone has come to you, to give you good news and warn you: God has
                                                    the power to do everything” (Q.5:19).</p>

                                                <p>The fifth pillar is belief in the Day of Judgment (Yawm al-Qiyāmah).
                                                    We believe in the certainty of life after death, the Day of
                                                    Judgment, and that each person will be held accountable for their
                                                    deeds. The belief in the Afterlife, including Heaven and Hell, is a
                                                    core aspect of Islamic eschatology (Murata & Chittick, 1994, p.
                                                    106).</p>

                                                <p>The final pillar is belief in Al-Qadr or divine predestination. We
                                                    believe Allāh has full knowledge and control over everything that
                                                    happens in the universe. They accept that everything, whether good
                                                    or evil, is within the domain of Allāh’s will and part of His divine
                                                    plan. This belief, however, does not negate human free will and
                                                    responsibility for their actions (Leaman, 2006, p. 279).</p>

                                                <p>The term īmān itself is derived from the Arabic root ‘amn’, which
                                                    means ‘security’ or ‘safety’ (Lane, 1984, p. 2266). Within the
                                                    Islamic context, īmān is a profound emotional and intellectual
                                                    conviction that offers internal peace and certainty. This conviction
                                                    is not static but subject to fluctuations based on deeds and
                                                    intentions (Al-Bukhārī, 48). Hence, īmān is dynamic, reflecting the
                                                    believer’s relationship with Allāh and their commitment to His
                                                    guidance.</p>

                                                <p>The term Allāh refers to the one true God in Islam. This term is
                                                    exclusive to God and can’t be pluralised or genderised, underlining
                                                    the transcendence of the Islamic concept of deity. It points to the
                                                    Islamic principle of tawhīd, the unshakeable belief in the oneness
                                                    of Allāh, which negates any possibility of polytheism, division, or
                                                    association with Allāh,</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">وَإِلَـٰهُكُمْ إِلَـٰهٌۭ وَٰحِدٌۭ ۖ لَّآ إِلَـٰهَ
                                                    إِلَّا هُوَ
                                                    ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ ١٦٣</p>

                                                <p>“Your God is the one God: there is no god except Him, the Lord of
                                                    Mercy, the Giver of Mercy” (Q. 2:163).</p>

                                                <p>The angels, or malā’ikah, are an integral part of Islamic cosmology.
                                                    Created from light (nūr), they lack free will and are perpetually
                                                    obedient to Allāh’s commands (Al-Bukhārī, Hadith 3328). The Qurʾān
                                                    mentions several angels by name, the most famous being Gabriel
                                                    (Jibrīl), entrusted with delivering divine revelations to the
                                                    prophets (Q. 26:193).</p>

                                                <p>The concept of divine revelation in Islam takes form in kutub, the
                                                    books of Allāh. We believe in four primary books: the Torah
                                                    (Tawrāt), the Psalms (Zabūr), the Gospel (Injīl), and the Qurʾān.
                                                    Each book was revealed to its respective Prophet, with the Qurʾān,
                                                    revealed to Prophet Muhammad, being the final and complete guidance
                                                    for humanity (Q. 4:163).</p>

                                                <p>Prophethood (nubuwwah) plays a central role in Islam. The Prophets
                                                    (rusul) were morally upright individuals Allāh chose to deliver His
                                                    message and guide their communities. The Qurʾān mentions 25 prophets
                                                    by name, although it states that there were many more throughout
                                                    history (Q. 40:78).</p>

                                                <p>The Islamic eschatological framework revolves around the belief in
                                                    the Day of Judgment (Yawm al-Qiyāmah). It includes the belief in the
                                                    resurrection (baʿth), accountability for actions (hisāb), the bridge
                                                    over Hell (sirāṭ), and the final destinations of Heaven (Jannah) and
                                                    Hell (Jahannam) (Qutb, 2000, p. 171).</p>

                                                <p>The final pillar of īmān is Al-Qadr, or predestination. This belief
                                                    involves the understanding that Allāh has full knowledge of
                                                    everything and that nothing occurs outside His will. It also
                                                    encompasses the concept of divine decree (qadā’), the implementation
                                                    of Allāh’s knowledge and will (El Fadl, 2014, p. 291).</p>

                                                <p>Collectively, these terms and concepts provide a comprehensive
                                                    understanding of Arkān al-īmān. Each word carries profound
                                                    implications for Muslim life, shaping their worldview, moral and
                                                    ethical conduct, and their relationship with Allāh.</p>

                                                <p>In the Islamic context, īmān is often translated as ‘faith’ or
                                                    ‘belief’. However, this definition falls short of capturing the
                                                    extensive depth of this term. It is instead an amalgamation of
                                                    belief, conviction, and action, a composite whole that signifies
                                                    complete submission and commitment to the principles of Islam
                                                    (Al-Bukhārī, Hadith 48).</p>

                                                <p>Derived from the Arabic root ‘amn’, īmān is intertwined with notions
                                                    of security and tranquillity, as noted by Lane (1984, p. 2266).
                                                    Consequently, it encapsulates an intrinsic sense of peace and safety
                                                    engendered by an unshakeable conviction in Allāh and the tenets of
                                                    Islam. This conviction emanates from the heart and is manifested
                                                    through the tongue and the limbs. It is evident in a Muslim’s
                                                    affirmation of faith (shahādah), prayers, and moral and ethical
                                                    conduct.</p>

                                                <p>Īmān is not a static entity; instead, it is dynamic and susceptible
                                                    to fluctuation. This understanding of īmān is based on several
                                                    hadiths, where Prophet Muhammad is reported to have said that īmān
                                                    “increases with good deeds and decreases with evil deeds”
                                                    (Al-Bukhārī, 48). The implications of īmān in the daily life of a
                                                    Muslim are multifold. First and foremost, it underscores the
                                                    relationship between a believer and Allāh. An individual with a
                                                    strong īmān recognises Allāh’s omnipresence and omniscience, which
                                                    nurtures a constant consciousness of Allāh, or taqwā. This
                                                    consciousness motivates believers to adhere to Allāh’s commands and
                                                    abstain from actions He has prohibited, as expressed in the Qurʾān:
                                                </p>

                                                <p class="arabic">يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ ٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ
                                                    حَقَّ تُقَاتِهِۦ
                                                    وَلَا تَمُوتُنَّ إِلَّا وَأَنتُم مُّسْلِمُونَ ١٠٢</p>

                                                <p>“O you who believe! Fear Allāh as He should be feared” (Q. 3:102).
                                                </p>

                                                <p>Moreover, īmān infuses life with purpose and direction. Īmān fosters
                                                    qualities such as honesty, humility, patience, and empathy, as
                                                    reflected in numerous Qurʾānic verses and hadiths. For example,
                                                    Prophet Muhammad said, “None of you [truly] believes until he wishes
                                                    for his brother what he wishes for himself” (Al-Bukhārī, 1997,
                                                    Hadith 13). This reflects the emphasis on brotherhood, compassion,
                                                    and selflessness in Islam.</p>

                                                <p>The belief in Allāh’s omnipotence and divine decree, or qadā’ and
                                                    qadar, inculcated by īmān, also plays a significant role in how a
                                                    Muslim deals with challenges and hardships. It instils resilience
                                                    and optimism, encouraging Us to perceive trials as tests from Allāh
                                                    and opportunities for spiritual growth. The Qurʾān reminds
                                                    believers:</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">وَلَنَبْلُوَنَّكُم بِشَىْءٍۢ مِّنَ ٱلْخَوْفِ
                                                    وَٱلْجُوعِ وَنَقْصٍۢ
                                                    مِّنَ ٱلْأَمْوَٰلِ وَٱلْأَنفُسِ وَٱلثَّمَرَٰتِ ۗ وَبَشِّرِ
                                                    ٱلصَّـٰبِرِينَ ١٥٥</p>

                                                <p>“And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a

                                                    patient” (Q. 2:155).</p>

                                                <p>Lastly, īmān underscores a sense of accountability and the belief in
                                                    life after death, which fundamentally influence a believer’s
                                                    perspective on life and death. It cultivates a consciousness of the
                                                    transitory nature of life and the eternal reality of the hereafter,
                                                    motivating Us to strive for righteousness and good deeds. The Qurʾān
                                                    states:</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">وَمَا ٱلْحَيَوٰةُ ٱلدُّنْيَآ إِلَّا لَعِبٌۭ وَلَهْوٌۭ
                                                    ۖ وَلَلدَّارُ
                                                    ٱلْـَٔاخِرَةُ خَيْرٌۭ لِّلَّذِينَ يَتَّقُونَ ۗ أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ
                                                    ٣٢</p>

                                                <p>“And the life of this world is nothing but play and amusement. But
                                                    far better is the house in the hereafter for those who are
                                                    Al-Muttaqūn (the pious). Will you not then understand?” (Q. 6:32).
                                                </p>

                                                <p>Exploring īmān as a feeling presents an intriguing dimension of faith
                                                    within the Islamic framework, particularly concerning emotional
                                                    management. Īmān, which inherently involves the heart, or qalb, in
                                                    Arabic, implicates many emotions and feelings (M.A.S. Abdel Haleem,
                                                    2005, p. 152).</p>

                                                <p>As we traverse through īmān’s complexities, it becomes evident that
                                                    īmān is more than a cognitive belief; it is also a profound
                                                    emotional experience (Al-Ghazālī, 2004, p. 45). This emotional
                                                    dimension is implied in the Qurʾān, in verses like:</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَتَطْمَئِنُّ قُلُوبُهُم بِذِكْرِ
                                                    ٱللَّهِ ۗ
                                                    أَلَا بِذِكْرِ ٱللَّهِ تَطْمَئِنُّ ٱلْقُلُوبُ ٢٨</p>

                                                <p>“those who believe, and whose hearts find satisfaction in the
                                                    remembrance of Allāh: for without doubt in the remembrance of Allāh
                                                    do hearts find satisfaction” (Q. 13:28).</p>

                                                <p>This satisfaction and tranquillity that stem from īmān delineate its
                                                    emotional aspect. While deeply personal, the emotional experience of
                                                    īmān is intricately tied to the communal experience of Us.
                                                    Collective rituals, such as the five daily prayers or the annual
                                                    pilgrimage to Mecca, cultivate shared emotions that strengthen
                                                    communal bonds and solidarity among believers (Hoffman, 2007, p.
                                                    123). This sense of belonging and unity nourishes emotional
                                                    well-being, offering a potent means for emotional management.</p>

                                                <p>One significant aspect of emotional management facilitated by īmān is
                                                    resilience in the face of adversity. A strong īmān engenders
                                                    emotional strength and resilience by cultivating a positive outlook,
                                                    patience (ṣabr), and reliance (tawakkul) on Allāh (Al-Qurṭubī, 2006,
                                                    Vol. 12, p. 255). The Qurʾān says:</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">قُل لَّن يُصِيبَنَآ إِلَّا مَا كَتَبَ ٱللَّهُ لَنَا
                                                    هُوَ مَوْلَىٰنَا
                                                    ۚ وَعَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ ٥١</p>

                                                <p>“Say, ‘Nothing will happen to us except what Allāh has decreed for
                                                    us: He is our protector’; and upon Allāh let the believers rely” (Q.
                                                    9:51). This verse encapsulates the decisive role of īmān in
                                                    emotional management, providing a sense of control and stability
                                                    amid life’s uncertainties.</p>


                                                <p>Moreover, īmān is critical in managing emotions such as fear and
                                                    anxiety. The belief in Allāh’s omnipotence and mercy, and the belief
                                                    in life after death, significantly alter a believer’s perspective on
                                                    life’s trials and tribulations. For instance, the Qurʾān says:</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَتَطْمَئِنُّ قُلُوبُهُم بِذِكْرِ
                                                    ٱللَّهِ ۗ
                                                    أَلَا بِذِكْرِ ٱللَّهِ تَطْمَئِنُّ ٱلْقُلُوبُ ٢٨</p>

                                                <p>“Those who have believed and whose hearts are assured by the
                                                    remembrance of Allāh. Unquestionably, by the remembrance of Allāh
                                                    hearts are assured” (13:28).</p>

                                                <p>The assurance provided by the remembrance of Allāh (dhikr) indicates
                                                    how īmān can help manage feelings of fear and anxiety, replacing
                                                    them with a sense of peace and serenity. Furthermore, īmān fosters
                                                    positive emotions such as gratitude (shukr) and contentment (riḍā).
                                                    Gratitude in Islam is not merely an emotional response but also a
                                                    virtue and an act of worship. The Qurʾān mentions:</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">وَإِذْ تَأَذَّنَ رَبُّكُمْ لَئِن شَكَرْتُمْ
                                                    لَأَزِيدَنَّكُمْ ۖ
                                                    وَلَئِن كَفَرْتُمْ إِنَّ عَذَابِى لَشَدِيدٌۭ ٧</p>

                                                <p>“If you are grateful, I will surely increase you [in favour]” (14:7).
                                                </p>

                                                <p>This promotes a positive attitude and emotional well-being.
                                                    Similarly, contentment, reflected in the Qurʾān as</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">مَآ أَصَابَ مِن مُّصِيبَةٍ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ ۗ
                                                    وَمَن يُؤْمِنۢ
                                                    بِٱللَّهِ يَهْدِ قَلْبَهُۥ ۚ وَٱللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌۭ ١١
                                                </p>

                                                <p>“No disaster strikes except by permission of Allāh. And whoever
                                                    believes in Allāh – He will guide his heart. And Allāh knows of all
                                                    things” (64:11),</p>

                                                <p>This is also a form of emotional management, promoting acceptance and
                                                    peace with Allāh’s decree. Finally, the emotion of hope (raja’) in
                                                    Allāh’s mercy and forgiveness is another crucial element of īmān
                                                    that aids emotional management. It helps individuals cope with guilt
                                                    or despair due to sins or mistakes, encouraging repentance and
                                                    positive change. As stated in the Qurʾān:</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">۞ قُلْ يَـٰعِبَادِىَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَسْرَفُوا۟ عَلَىٰٓ

                                                    sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allāh. Indeed, Allāh
                                                    forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the
                                                    Merciful'” (39:53).</p>

                                                <p>The exploration of īmān necessitates concurrently examining its
                                                    counterpoints, kufr and nifāq, to comprehend its Islamic
                                                    significance fully. Kufr, often translated as disbelief or
                                                    infidelity, and nifāq, usually interpreted as hypocrisy, are opposed
                                                    to īmān in the Islamic paradigm (Asad, 1980, p. 43).</p>

                                                <p>The term kufr originates from the Arabic root k-f-r, which implies to
                                                    ‘cover’ or ‘conceal’. In the religious context, it refers to the
                                                    denial or rejection of the fundamental tenets of Islam, either
                                                    through disbelief or ungratefulness towards Allāh (Ibn Manẓūr, 2002,
                                                    Vol. 2, p. 771). As the Qurʾān stipulates:</p>

                                                <p>“Verily, those who disbelieve in Allāh and His Messengers and wish to

                                                    some but reject others,’ and wish to adopt a way in between. They
                                                    are in truth disbelievers” (4:150-151).</p>
                                                <p>This verse highlights the absolute nature of kufr—it involves a total
                                                    rejection of the monotheistic premise upon which īmān rests.
                                                    However, kufr should not be narrowly perceived as intellectual
                                                    denial alone; it also involves a rejection through actions and
                                                    attitudes. The Qurʾān cautions</p>

                                                    (4:136).</p>

                                                <p>This verse suggests that kufr extends beyond belief to encompass
                                                    actions, such as neglecting religious duties and dismissing ethical
                                                    guidelines established by Allāh and His Messengers. Nifāq, on the
                                                    other hand, denotes an insincere profession of faith, where outward
                                                    expressions of belief mask an inner reality of disbelief. The Qurʾān
                                                    warns,</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يَقُولُ ءَامَنَّا بِٱللَّهِ
                                                    وَبِٱلْيَوْمِ
                                                    ٱلْـَٔاخِرِ وَمَا هُم بِمُؤْمِنِينَ ٨</p>

                                                <p>“And of mankind, there are some who say: ‘We believe in Allāh and the
                                                    Last Day’ while they believe not” (2:8). This verse delineates the
                                                    core of nifāq—a dichotomy between inner and outer states of belief.
                                                </p>

                                                <p>Nifāq is further classified into two types: nifāq in belief and nifāq
                                                    in action (Ibn Kathīr, 2003, Vol. 2, p. 37). Nifāq in belief refers
                                                    to internal disbelief disguised by an outward profession of faith.
                                                    In contrast, nifāq in action signifies a discrepancy between a
                                                    believer’s declared beliefs and actions, although they might
                                                    genuinely believe in the heart. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon
                                                    him) specified signs of hypocrisy: lying when speaking, breaking
                                                    promises, betraying trust, using foul language, and showing
                                                    hostility in disputes (Bukhārī, 6095).</p>

                                                <p>The implications of kufr and nifāq within Islamic theology are
                                                    profound. They oppose īmān and are considered grave sins with severe
                                                    consequences in the hereafter (Esack, 2002, p. 109). The Qurʾān
                                                    states,</p>

                                                <p class="arabic">إِنَّ ٱلْمُنَـٰفِقِينَ فِى ٱلدَّرْكِ ٱلْأَسْفَلِ مِنَ

                                                <p>“Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depth (grade) of the
                                                    Fire; no helper will you find for them” (Q. 4:145).</p>

                                                <p>This verse indicates the gravity of kufr and nifāq, demonstrating
                                                    their severe implications for an individual’s spiritual standing and
                                                    Afterlife. Nevertheless, it is crucial to remember that the
                                                    judgement of kufr and nifāq ultimately rests with Allāh alone. As
                                                    the Qurʾān explains,</p>

                                                <p>“Allāh will not leave the believers in the state in which you are now
                                                    until He distinguishes the wicked from the good” (Q. 3:179).</p>

                                                <p>This verse underscores the divine prerogative in discerning the
                                                    actual state of an individual’s īmān, cautioning against hasty

                                                <p>Firstly, Allāh’s act of creation is central to Islamic belief. The
                                                    Qurʾān repeatedly emphasises that Allāh is the Creator of everything
                                                    in existence:</p>

                                                <p  class="arabic">ٱللَّهُ خَـٰلِقُ كُلِّ شَىْءٍۢ ۖ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍۢ وَكِيلٌۭ
                                                    ٦٢</p>

                                                <p>“Allāh is the Creator of all things, and He is, over all things,
                                                    Disposer of affairs” (Q. 39:62). His creative act is not only
                                                    understood as an initial act of bringing the universe into
                                                    existence, but also a continuous process whereby He sustains and
                                                    governs all creation. In the act of creation, We see evidence of
                                                    Allāh’s wisdom, knowledge, and power (Nasr, 1993, p. 77).</p>

                                                <p>Allāh’s providence, or His act of providing for His creation, is
                                                    another crucial facet of understanding His actions. The Qurʾān
                                                    states,</p>

                                                <p  class="arabic">۞ وَمَا مِن دَآبَّةٍۢ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ إِلَّا عَلَى ٱللَّهِ رِزْقُهَا
                                                    وَيَعْلَمُ مُسْتَقَرَّهَا وَمُسْتَوْدَعَهَا ۚ كُلٌّۭ فِى كِتَـٰبٍۢ
                                                    مُّبِينٍۢ ٦</p>

                                                <p>“And there is no creature on earth but that upon Allāh is its
                                                    provision” (Q. 11:6). This attribute underscores Allāh’s continuous
                                                    care and concern for all creatures, as well as His knowledge of
                                                    their needs. According to Leaman (2008), understanding Allāh’s
                                                    providence fosters gratitude and dependence on Allāh among believers

                                                <p>In addition, Allāh’s guidance is a recurrent theme in the Qurʾān. It
                                                    is He who guides individuals to the straight path (al-Ṣirāṭ
                                                    al-Mustaqīm), facilitating their spiritual development and moral
                                                    rectitude.</p>

                                                <p  class="arabic">إِنَّكَ لَا تَهْدِى مَنْ أَحْبَبْتَ وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَهْدِى مَن
                                                    يَشَآءُ ۚ وَهُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِٱلْمُهْتَدِينَ ٥٦</p>

                                                <p>“Indeed, you (O Muhammad) guide not whom you like, but Allāh guides
                                                    whom He wills. And He knows best those who are the guided” (Q.
                                                    28:56).</p>

                                                <p>Allāh’s guidance, or hidāyah, is perceived as a divine gift,
                                                    prompting individuals towards faith (īmān) and good deeds (ʿamal
                                                    ṣāliḥ) (Rahman, 2009, p. 64). Furthermore, Allāh, as the Judge, who
                                                    rewards and punishes, is pivotal in Islamic belief. Allāh says,</p>

                                                <p  class="arabic">وَنَضَعُ ٱلْمَوَٰزِينَ ٱلْقِسْطَ لِيَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَـٰمَةِ فَلَا
                                                    تُظْلَمُ نَفْسٌۭ شَيْـًۭٔا ۖ وَإِن كَانَ مِثْقَالَ حَبَّةٍۢ مِّنْ

                                                <p>“And We shall set up balances of justice on the Day of Resurrection,
                                                    then none will be dealt with unjustly in anything” (Q. 21:47).</p>

                                                <p>This asserts that Allāh will evaluate every individual’s action,
                                                    dispensing justice with perfect fairness. It imbues human actions
                                                    with profound moral significance and inculcates a sense of personal
                                                    accountability (Winter, 2010, p. 214). However, it is also crucial
                                                    to understand Allāh’s mercy (raḥmah) and forgiveness (ghufrān) in
                                                    balance with His justice. The Qurʾān opens with the words,</p>

                                                <p  class="arabic">۞ قُلْ يَـٰعِبَادِىَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَسْرَفُوا۟ عَلَىٰٓ أَنفُسِهِمْ لَا
                                                    تَقْنَطُوا۟ مِن رَّحْمَةِ ٱللَّهِ ۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَغْفِرُ
                                                    ٱلذُّنُوبَ جَمِيعًا ۚ إِنَّهُۥ هُوَ ٱلْغَفُورُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ ٥٣</p>

                                                <p>“In the name of Allāh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.” Indeed,
                                                    Allāh describes Himself as “Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” (Q.
                                                    39:53),</p>

                                                <p>Signalling His inclination towards forgiveness and mercy.
                                                    Understanding these divine actions enables believers to foster hope
                                                    and aspire for Allāh’s mercy while being cognisant of His justice.
                                                    While We believe that every event in the universe is a result of
                                                    Allāh’s will (mashīʾah), Islamic scholars stress the importance of
                                                    understanding Allāh’s actions within the framework of human free
                                                    will. This paradoxical interplay between divine will and human
                                                    freedom is a subject of ongoing theological discourse within Islam
                                                    (Leaman, 2008, p. 104).</p>

                                                <p>The Names of Allāh, often known as al-asmā’ al-ḥusnā or “the Most
                                                    Beautiful Names,” hold a profound significance in Islamic theology.
                                                    Allāh refers to these names in the Qurʾān as a means for human
                                                    beings to understand His divine essence and attributes,</p>

                                                <p  class="arabic">وَلِلَّهِ ٱلْأَسْمَآءُ ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ فَٱدْعُوهُ بِهَا ۖ وَذَرُوا۟
                                                    ٱلَّذِينَ يُلْحِدُونَ فِىٓ أَسْمَـٰٓئِهِۦ ۚ سَيُجْزَوْنَ مَا
                                                    كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ ١٨٠</p>

                                                <p>“And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allāh, so call on Him
                                                    by them” (Q. 7:180).</p>

                                                <p>Among these names, Allāh, alternately transcribed as El-Lah in some
                                                    sources, holds a unique status and warrants focused attention. The
                                                    name “Allāh” is derived from the Arabic word “ilāh,” meaning deity
                                                    or God. In its definite form, al-ilāh or “the God” signifies the
                                                    supreme deity deserving of all worship. Over time, the linguistic
                                                    use evolved, and the term was contracted to Allāh, designating the
                                                    monotheistic God of Islam (Armstrong, 1993, p. 39).</p>

                                                <p>The name Allāh comprises the essence of tawḥīd (Islamic monotheism),
                                                    underscoring the belief in one God who is singular, unique, and
                                                    unlike His creation. The Qurʾān elucidates this concept in the
                                                    chapter al-Ikhlāṣ (The Sincerity),</p>

                                                <p  class="arabic">قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ ١ ٱللَّهُ ٱلصَّمَدُ ٢ لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ
                                                    يُولَدْ ٣ وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُۥ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌۢ ٤</p>

                                                <p>“Say: He is Allāh, the One and Only; Allāh, the Eternal, Absolute; He
                                                    begets not, nor was He begotten; And there is none like unto Him”
                                                    (Q. 112:1-4).</p>

                                                <p>This name is not only the most frequently used in the Qurʾān but also
                                                    forms the basis of the Islamic confession of faith (shahādah),
                                                    “There is no deity worthy of worship except Allāh” (Lings, 2005, p.
                                                    27). Hence, the name Allāh holds central importance in the life of a
                                                    Muslim, used in daily rituals, prayers, and supplications.</p>

                                                <p>An essential aspect of understanding the name Allāh lies in the
                                                    knowledge that it encompasses all the divine attributes without
                                                    exclusion. It is comprehensive, capturing all other names and
                                                    qualities of God (Gardet, 2009, p. 54). When believers invoke Allāh,
                                                    they indirectly call upon all His attributes, making it the most
                                                    potent of all His names.</p>

                                               
                                                <p>However, it is necessary to note that while the name Allāh provides a
                                                    framework for understanding divine qualities, it does not encompass
                                                    the entirety of God’s ineffable essence. As al-Ghazālī (2004)
                                                    elucidates, the names of Allāh only provide a means for human beings
                                                    to approach the divine mystery without ever fully comprehending it
                                                    (p. 81).</p>

                                                <p>The theological implications of the name Allāh are numerous. It
                                                    necessitates the believer’s complete surrender and submission,
                                                    recognising Allāh as the sole authority in all spheres of life. It
                                                    also cultivates an attitude of humble adoration and veneration
                                                    towards Allāh, acknowledging His omnipotence and omniscience.</p>

                                                <p>Moreover, the name Allāh also fosters spiritual and ethical
                                                    transformation. As Murata & Chittick (1994) suggest, knowing Allāh’s
                                                    names encourages individuals to reflect these divine attributes in
                                                    their behaviour, inspiring them to cultivate traits such as mercy
                                                    (raḥmah), justice (‘adl), and kindness (iḥsān) (p. 77).</p>

                                                <p>The existence of God has been a topic of discourse among theologians,
                                                    philosophers, and scientists across cultures and epochs. Islamic
                                                    tradition has formulated several theological arguments to
                                                    substantiate the existence of God, rooted in the Qurʾān, Hadith, and
                                                    intellectual reasoning. These arguments, in essence, seek to affirm
                                                    the Qurʾānic verse,</p>

                                                <p  class="arabic">إِنَّ فِى خَلْقِ ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَٱخْتِلَـٰفِ ٱلَّيْلِ

                                                <p>“Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the
                                                    alternation of the night and the day are signs for those of
                                                    understanding” (Q. 3:190).</p>

                                                <p>The Argument from Design, or Teleological Argument, is one such
                                                    contention used to establish the existence of God. It posits that
                                                    the order, complexity, and purpose observed in the universe indicate
                                                    the hand of an intelligent designer. The Qurʾān often directs the
                                                    reader’s attention to the precision and intricacy of natural
                                                    phenomena as indicators of a purposeful Creator,</p>

                                                <p>“And within the land are neighbouring plots and gardens of grapevines
                                                    and crops and palm trees, [growing] several from a root or

                                                    who reason” (Q. 13:4).</p>

                                                <p>This argument resonates with the cosmological observations made by
                                                    contemporary scientists, adding to its relevance (Barbour, 1990).
                                                    The Cosmological Argument, or the Argument from First Cause, is
                                                    another persuasive argument positing that everything has a cause,
                                                    leading back to an uncaused First Cause or a Necessary Being,
                                                    identified as God. The Qurʾān substantiates this argument, asserting
                                                    God as the Originator of the heavens and the earth, “He is the
                                                    Originator of the heavens and the earth…” (Q. 6:101). Al-Ghazālī,
                                                    the influential Islamic scholar, further developed this argument,
                                                    arguing that the contingent nature of the universe necessitates a
                                                    Necessary Being (Frank, 2000).</p>

                                                <p>The Moral Argument, albeit less utilised in traditional Islamic
                                                    discourse, has gained attention in contemporary Islamic philosophy.
                                                    It contends that moral values and duties imply a moral lawgiver,
                                                    identified as God. While the Qurʾān does not present a direct moral
                                                    argument for God’s existence, it emphasises the role of God as the
                                                    ultimate judge and the source of moral guidance,</p>

                                                    not among those who associated others with Allah'” (Q. 6:161).</p>

                                                <p>Contemporary Muslim philosophers such as Seyyed Hossein Nasr and
                                                    Tariq Ramadan have further explored this argument (Nasr, 2001;
                                                    Ramadan, 2004). Although not explicitly formulated in the classical
                                                    Islamic tradition, the Argument from Consciousness has recently
                                                    gained attention. It holds that the existence of consciousness and
                                                    self-awareness in human beings implies a conscious Creator. This
                                                    argument aligns with the Qurʾānic emphasis on the human ability for
                                                    self-reflection and reasoning as signs of divine creation,</p>

                                                <p>Contemporary Islamic scholars such as Hamza Yusuf have explored this
                                                    argument more deeply (Yusuf, 2015). Within the rich heritage of
                                                    Islamic thought, philosophical and rational arguments serve as
                                                    instrumental tools to reconcile faith and reason and elucidate
                                                    Islam’s spiritual and moral tenets. The philosophers and scholars of
                                                    Islam have developed an array of arguments to establish God’s
                                                    existence and address intricate matters of theology, morality,
                                                    metaphysics, and cosmology.</p>

                                                <p>The kalam cosmological argument, which emerged within Islamic
                                                    scholastic theology (kalam), is a crucial rational argument. The
                                                    Muslim philosopher and theologian, Al-Ghazālī famously formulated
                                                    this argument, contending that the universe, due to its contingent
                                                    and finite nature, must have a cause, identified as God, the
                                                    Necessary Being (Frank, 2000). Al-Ghazālī’s argument, particularly
                                                    his emphasis on the temporal origination of the universe, has
                                                    remained influential within Islamic thought and significantly
                                                    impacted Western philosophical discourse.</p>

                                                <p>Another central rational argument within Islamic philosophy is the
                                                    argument from design or teleological argument. This argument,
                                                    elucidated by Islamic scholars like Ibn Rushd and Ibn Sina, posits
                                                    that the intricate design and order observed in the universe
                                                    indicate a designer, i.e., God. In his commentaries on Aristotle’s
                                                    works, Ibn Rushd argued that the regularities and laws of nature
                                                    evince an intelligent principle or cause (Leaman, 1988).
                                                    Simultaneously, Ibn Sina, in his metaphysical treatise ‘The Cure,’
                                                    stated that the universe’s harmony and unity manifest divine wisdom
                                                    (Nasr & Leaman, 1996).</p>

                                                <p>Moreover, the moral argument is another significant rational
                                                    contention within the Islamic tradition. Although this argument is
                                                    less prominent within classical Islamic philosophy, it has gained
                                                    increasing attention in contemporary Islamic thought. The moral
                                                    argument holds that the existence of moral values and duties within
                                                    the world necessitates a moral lawgiver, identified as God.
                                                    Contemporary Islamic scholars such as Seyyed Hossein Nasr and Tariq
                                                    Ramadan have elaborated upon this argument, asserting that the
                                                    universal moral principles found within Islam indicate a divine
                                                    source (Nasr, 2001; Ramadan, 2004).</p>

                                                <p>Similarly, although not a traditional argument within the Islamic
                                                    discourse, the argument from consciousness has recently gained
                                                    traction among Muslim scholars. This argument suggests that human
                                                    consciousness and self-awareness presuppose a conscious Creator.
                                                    This line of reasoning resonates with the Qurʾānic emphasis on human
                                                    cognition and intellect as divine gifts and signs of God’s existence
                                                    (Yusuf, 2015).</p>

                                                <p>Furthermore, the argument from religious experience has found
                                                    extensive mention in the works of Sufi scholars like Rumi and Ibn
                                                    Arabi. They emphasised

                                                    individuals’ spiritual experiences as personal affirmations of God’s
                                                    existence (Chittick, 1989). While subjective and contingent on
                                                    personal experience, this argument still holds sway among many
                                                    within the Islamic tradition.</p>

                                                    Islamic belief. The nature, roles, and ranks of angels are diverse
                                                    and complex, explored extensively within the Islamic tradition’s
                                                    corpus (Renard, 2008). Angels are defined as celestial beings
                                                    created by Allāh from nūr (light), devoid of physical desires, and

                                                    serve as intermediaries between Allāh and His creation, performing

                                                    Jibrīl, arguably the most recognised angel within the Islamic
                                                    tradition, is often equated with the Holy Spirit (Al-Rūḥ al-Qudus)
                                                    (Q. 16:102). As Allāh’s chief Messenger, Jibrīl is responsible for
                                                    conveying divine revelations to the prophets, most notably
                                                    delivering the Qurʾān to Prophet Muhammad (Al-Bukhari, 3). He is

                                                    understanding and exposition of the divine message (Brown, 2009).

                                                    Mīkāl, another high-ranking angel, is primarily associated with
                                                    providence, controlling the forces of nature, including rainfall and
                                                    vegetation (Q. 2:98). Islamic tradition depicts Mīkāl as a
                                                    compassionate angel, often weeping over the sight of hellfire and
                                                    the fate of sinners, which signifies his deep concern for human
                                                    well-being (Al-Suyūṭī, 2003).

                                                    Isrāfīl, albeit not directly mentioned in the Qurʾān, is central
                                                    within the Islamic eschatological narrative. Isrāfīl is typically
                                                    depicted holding a trumpet, which he will blow twice to mark the end

                                                    associated with the resurrection motif, symbolising the cyclical
                                                    nature of existence and the inescapable reality of divine justice

                                                    fulfilling divine commands, reaffirming the inevitability of death

                                                    The ranks of angels in Islam are hierarchical, with archangels such
                                                    as Jibrīl, Mīkāl, Isrāfīl, and ʿIzrā’īl holding prominent positions.
                                                    However, it’s crucial to note that rank does not denote favour but
                                                    indicates a hierarchy of function and responsibility. In their
                                                    different roles and capacities, the angels work in harmony to

                                                    The investigation into the identities of Beelzebul and Azazel
                                                    demands a multidisciplinary approach, drawing from biblical,
                                                    apocryphal, and Islamic sources, archaeological evidence, and
                                                    linguistic analysis. By investigating these figures’ origins,
                                                    natures, and roles, we might better understand their portrayal in

                                                    significance.

                                                    Beelzebul, also known as Beelzebub, is a figure in the New Testament
                                                    of the Christian Bible, particularly in the synoptic gospels of
                                                    Matthew, Mark, and Luke (Twelftree, 2007). His name is derived from
                                                    the Canaanite god Baal Zebub, often translated as ‘Lord of the
                                                    Flies,’ a deity worshipped in the Philistine city of Ekron (2 Kings
                                                    1:2-3, NRSV). However, in the synoptic gospels, Beelzebul is
                                                    portrayed as a powerful demon, if not Satan himself. Some
                                                    interpretations suggest that the name Beelzebul, meaning ‘Lord of
                                                    the House’ in Hebrew, might signify the demon’s authority over other
                                                    evil spirits (Horsley, 2012).

                                                    On the other hand, Azazel is a figure mentioned in the Hebrew Bible,
                                                    particularly in Leviticus 16, in the context of the Yom Kippur
                                                    ritual. The high priest was instructed to send a goat, known as the
                                                    ‘scapegoat,’ into the wilderness, symbolically carrying the
                                                    community’s sins to Azazel (Milgrom, 2004). While early
                                                    interpretations considered Azazel a desolate place or a symbol of
                                                    complete removal, later Jewish, Christian, and occult traditions
                                                    often portrayed Azazel as a demonic or fallen angelic entity.
                                                    Notably, the Book of Enoch, a Jewish pseudepigraphical work,
                                                    portrays Azazel as a fallen Watcher, a leader among angels who
                                                    sinned by teaching humanity forbidden knowledge and producing
                                                    offspring with human women (1 Enoch 8:1-2; 9:6; 10:4-6).

                                                <p>
                                                    In Islamic tradition, neither Beelzebul nor Azazel appears by these
                                                    names. However, some scholars suggest that Iblīs, the Qurʾānic
                                                    figure who refuses Allāh’s command to bow to Adam and is
                                                    subsequently cast out of heaven (Q. 7:11-18), shares similarities
                                                    with both. The portrayal of Iblīs mirrors the New Testament’s
                                                    depiction of Beelzebul as a high-ranking demonic entity opposing
                                                    God’s will. Moreover, Azazel’s characterisation as a fallen angel
                                                    teaching forbidden knowledge resonates with Iblīs’s role as a
                                                    tempter, leading humanity astray (El-Zein, 2009). It’s worth noting,
                                                    however, that these parallels do not necessarily indicate that
                                                    Beelzebul and Azazel are directly equated with Iblīs in Islamic
                                                    tradition.

                                                    A linguistic examination can provide further insight into these
                                                    identities. The morphological transformation of Beelzebul from Baal
                                                    Zebub (‘Lord of Flies’) to Baal Zebul (‘Lord of the High House’) is
                                                    believed to be a deliberate attempt by the biblical authors to
                                                    denigrate the Canaanite deity and undermine its authority
                                                    (Stuckenbruck, 2003). Similarly, the term Azazel is etymologically
                                                    ambiguous, with proposed meanings including ‘God strengthens,’
                                                    ‘entire removal,’ or ‘rough, rugged’ – the latter two aligning with
                                                    the interpretation of Azazel as a wilderness demon (Day, 2002).

                                                    Angels (malā’ikah), according to Islamic theology, are celestial
                                                    beings created by Allāh from light (nūr). They are inherently
                                                    obedient to Allāh’s commands and perform various tasks in the

                                                    of both belief (īmān) and disbelief, freedom and responsibility
                                                    analogous to humans (Q. 72:1-14; 6:130). Jinn can engage with humans
                                                    in various ways, from peaceful coexistence to malicious possession,
                                                    which the Islamic tradition addresses with rites of exorcism
                                                    (ruqyah).

                                                    The relationship between humans and angels is often depicted as one
                                                    of guidance and support. Islamic tradition maintains that each
                                                    person is accompanied by two angels, the Kirāman Kātibīn, who record
                                                    their deeds, with the angel on the right noting the good actions and
                                                    the angel on the left commenting on the evil ones (Q. 50:17-18).
                                                    Moreover, the angel Jibrīl (Gabriel) holds a significant role,
                                                    conveying Allāh’s revelations to the prophets, most notably to the
                                                    Prophet Muhammad during the Night of Power (Laylat al-Qadr) (Q.
                                                    97:1-5; Bukhari 3).

                                                <p>
                                                    On the other hand, the Qurʾān also refers to the jinn’s ability to
                                                    influence human behaviour, both positively and negatively. The jinn
                                                    can inspire people towards evil, as in the case of Iblīs, who
                                                    refused to bow before Adam and became the archetypal tempter (Q.
                                                    2:34; 7:20- 22). However, there are also accounts of believing jinn
                                                    who inspire and assist humans, as depicted in the story of King
                                                    Solomon, who had the power to control and collaborate with jinn in
                                                    his kingdom (Q. 27:17-44).

                                                <p>
                                                    While angels and jinn have capacities for influencing human affairs,
                                                    their interactions with humans operate on different moral and
                                                    metaphysical planes. Angels are agents of divine will, promoting
                                                    truth, justice, and spiritual development. In contrast, jinn have
                                                    moral agency akin to humans; their influence spans a broad moral
                                                    spectrum, ranging from benevolent to malevolent.

                                                    The dynamic triadic interactions between humans, angels, and jinn
                                                    reflect the broader cosmological framework in Islam, in which
                                                    physical and spiritual realities are deeply intertwined. These
                                                    interactions provide a locus for exploring existential questions of
                                                    free will, moral responsibility, and the role of unseen forces in an
                                                    individual’s life and the broader universe.

                                                    The story of the fall of certain angels, most notably Iblīs, holds a
                                                    critical position within Islamic theology, exploring free will,
                                                    disobedience, and the consequences of pride. It provides a prism
                                                    through which we can examine the theological implications and
                                                    lessons derived from these narratives.

                                                <p>
                                                    The most prominent narrative is Iblīs’s rebellion against Allāh’s
                                                    command to prostrate to Adam. In the Islamic tradition, Iblīs is
                                                    often considered a jinni.

                                                    down, but not Iblis: he was one of the jinns, and he disobeyed his
                                                    Lord’s command. Are you [people] going to take him and his offspring

                                                    What a bad bargain for the evildoers! (Q. 18:50)

                                                    defining moment of Iblīs’s fall comes with his refusal to obey

                                                    ‘Bow down before Adam,’ and they did. But not Iblis: he was not one
                                                    of those who bowed down. God said, ‘What prevented you from bowing
                                                    down as I commanded you?’ and he said, ‘I am better than him: You
                                                    created me from fire and him from clay’” (Q. 7:11-12).

                                                    Iblīs’ justification for his disobedience was his perceived
                                                    superiority over Adam, as he was created from smokeless fire,
                                                    whereas Adam was made from clay (Q. 38:76). Consequently, Iblīs was
                                                    cast out from the divine presence and became a paradigm of pride;
                                                    disobedience, and unbelief (kufr) in Islamic theology (El-Badawi,

                                                    The narrative of Iblīs’s fall holds profound theological
                                                    implications. Firstly, it underscores the sanctity of Allāh’s
                                                    commands and the necessity of absolute obedience, regardless of
                                                    personal reasoning. Iblīs’s sin was disobedience and his presumption
                                                    in arguing with Allāh’s decree, manifesting excessive pride and
                                                    self-reliance (Al-Ashqar, 2003).

                                                <p>
                                                    Secondly, the narrative emphasises the dangers of pride and
                                                    arrogance. Islamic theology holds that Iblīs’s disobedience stemmed
                                                    from his arrogance over his origin, illustrating how arrogance can
                                                    lead to moral and spiritual downfall. It serves as a reminder that
                                                    virtue lies not in one’s origin or abilities but in one’s humility
                                                    and obedience to Allāh (Rahman, 2012).

                                                    Thirdly, the fall of Iblīs provides insights into the nature of evil
                                                    in Islamic theology. Iblīs becomes the archetypal source of
                                                    temptation, seeking to lead humans astray from Allāh’s path (Q.
                                                    7:16-17). However, the Qurʾān emphasises that Iblīs has no power
                                                    over those who believe and rely on their Lord (Q. 16:99). Therefore,
                                                    the story serves as a metaphor for the inner struggle (jihad
                                                    al-nafs) against one’s lower desires and ego (nafs).

                                                    Notably, the Islamic tradition distinguishes Iblīs and the other
                                                    angels. While Iblīs fell from grace due to his disobedience, angels
                                                    are considered infallible, always obeying Allāh’s commands (Q.
                                                    66:6). This distinction marks a departure from some Christian and
                                                    Jewish interpretations, which narrate a rebellion among a group of
                                                    angels, casting them as fallen angels. In contrast, Islamic theology
                                                    affirms the moral impeccability of angels, emphasising their role as
                                                    instruments of divine will and guidance.

                                                <p>Belief in divine books (Kutub) is one of Islam’s six articles of
                                                    faith (Arkān al-īmān). The Qur’an refers to four divine books: the
                                                    Torah (Tawrah), the Psalms (Zabūr), the Gospel (Injīl), and the
                                                    Qurʾān itself. This article will offer an understanding of the
                                                    significance and content of these holy scriptures.</p>

                                                <p>The Torah, given to Prophet Moses (Mūsā), is the earliest of the
                                                    divine books mentioned in the Qur’an. Allāh says: “Indeed, We sent
                                                    down the Torah, in which was guidance and light” (Q. 5:44). The
                                                    Torah constitutes the primary law (Shari’ah) for the Israelites,
                                                    containing detailed regulations on religious observances, civil and
                                                    criminal law, and ethical teachings (Peters, 1990). It has immense
                                                    significance in forming the Jewish identity and covenant with Allāh.
                                                </p>

                                                <p>The Zabūr, given to Prophet David (Dāwūd), is mentioned in the
                                                    Qur’an:</p>

                                                <p  class="arabic">وَلَقَدْ كَتَبْنَا فِى ٱلزَّبُورِ مِنۢ بَعْدِ ٱلذِّكْرِ أَنَّ
                                                    ٱلْأَرْضَ يَرِثُهَا عِبَادِىَ ٱلصَّـٰلِحُونَ ١٠٥</p>

                                                <p>“And We have already written in the book [of Psalms] after the
                                                    [previous] mention that My righteous servants inherit the land [of
                                                    Paradise]” (Q. 21:105).</p>

                                                <p>While less is known about the Zabūr’s specific contents, it is
                                                    generally understood to contain David’s prayers, hymns, and wisdom.
                                                    Its primary function is considered as a source of spiritual guidance
                                                    and contemplation (Ayoub, 2007).</p>

                                                <p>The Injīl revealed to Prophet Jesus (ʿĪsā) is described in the Qur’an
                                                    as a confirmation of the Torah:</p>

                                                <p  class="arabic">وَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَا مُوسَى ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ وَقَفَّيْنَا مِنۢ بَعْدِهِۦ
                                                    بِٱلرُّسُلِ ۖ وَءَاتَيْنَا عِيسَى ٱبْنَ مَرْيَمَ ٱلْبَيِّنَـٰتِ
                                                    وَأَيَّدْنَـٰهُ بِرُوحِ ٱلْقُدُسِ ۗ أَفَكُلَّمَا جَآءَكُمْ رَسُولٌۢ
                                                    بِمَا لَا تَهْوَىٰٓ أَنفُسُكُمُ ٱسْتَكْبَرْتُمْ فَفَرِيقًۭا
                                                    كَذَّبْتُمْ وَفَرِيقًۭا تَقْتُلُونَ ٨٧</p>

                                                <p>“And We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, clear proofs and supported him
                                                    with the Pure Spirit. But is it [not] that every time a messenger
                                                    came to you, [O Children of Israel], with what your souls did not
                                                    desire, you were arrogant?” (Q. 2:87).</p>

                                                <p>The Injīl is seen as containing Jesus’s prophetic teachings,
                                                    emphasising spirituality, repentance, and Allāh’s mercy, marking a
                                                    shift from the legalistic orientation of the Torah (Accad, 2003).
                                                    Lastly, the Qur’an, revealed to Prophet Muhammad, is viewed as the
                                                    final and most comprehensive divine book. It confirms the truth in
                                                    the previous scriptures, corrects any alterations (tahrif), and
                                                    provides a complete guide for human life. As stated in the Qurʾān:
                                                </p>

                                                <p  class="arabic">ذَٰلِكَ ٱلْكِتَـٰبُ لَا رَيْبَ ۛ فِيهِ ۛ هُدًۭى لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ ٢</p>

                                                <p>“This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those
                                                    conscious of Allāh” (Q. 2:2).</p>

                                                <p>The Qur’an addresses all aspects of life, including belief, worship,
                                                    ethics, law, and society. Its overarching theme is the unity of
                                                    Allāh (tawhīd) and humanity’s responsibility towards Him (Sardar,
                                                    2011). The belief in these divine books signifies the
                                                    acknowledgement of a chain of prophetic revelations culminating in
                                                    Islam. It connotes respect for the shared Abrahamic heritage while
                                                    maintaining the distinctiveness and finality of the Qur’anic
                                                    message. It is important to note that while we believe in the divine
                                                    origin of these scriptures, they also hold that their original
                                                    messages have been distorted over time, except for the Qur’an, which
                                                    they believe to be preserved in its original form (Ernst, 2011).</p>

                                                <p>The languages of revelation, or in which divine scriptures were
                                                    initially revealed, hold immense significance within the framework
                                                    of Islamic theology. The three major languages in this context are
                                                    Hebrew, Aramaic, and Arabic – corresponding to the Torah, Injīl
                                                    (Gospel), and Qurʾān, respectively.</p>

                                                <p>In Islamic belief, the languages of revelation are more than mere
                                                    vehicles for divine communication. They’re regarded as divinely
                                                    chosen, meticulously structured to reflect the profundity of their
                                                    divine message (Mir, 2014). This is particularly emphasised in the
                                                    context of Arabic, the language of the Qurʾān, as it states,</p>

                                                <p  class="arabic">إِنَّا جَعَلْنَـٰهُ قُرْءَٰنًا عَرَبِيًّۭا لَّعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ ٣
                                                </p>

                                                <p>“Indeed, We have made it an Arabic Qurʾān that you might understand”
                                                    (Q. 43:3).</p>

                                                <p>Hebrew, the language of the Torah, holds significance in Jewish and
                                                    Islamic traditions. While Muslim scholars acknowledge its divine
                                                    origin, they emphasise that the Torah’s Hebrew texts have undergone
                                                    alterations (tahrif) over time. However, this still does not
                                                    diminish the Hebrew scriptures’ profound linguistic and literary
                                                    value, which continue to inspire numerous interpretations and
                                                    commentaries within the Jewish tradition (Robinson, 2004).</p>

                                                <p>Aramaic, the language of the Injīl, has often been overlooked due to
                                                    the predominance of Greek in extant New Testament manuscripts.
                                                    However, many scholars agree that Aramaic was likely the mother
                                                    tongue of Jesus (ʿĪsā) and the language he taught. Understanding
                                                    Aramaic can offer valuable insights into the linguistic context of
                                                    the Injīl’s initial revelation and enrich comparative scriptural
                                                    studies (Casey, 1998).</p>

                                                <p>Arabic, the language of the Qurʾān, is considered sacred within the
                                                    Islamic tradition. Its significance lies in its richness and
                                                    complexity, capable of conveying the multilayered meanings of the
                                                    Qurʾān. Knowledge of Arabic facilitates a deeper understanding of
                                                    the Qurʾān and fosters a direct, unmediated relationship with the
                                                    divine text. As Allāh says,</p>

                                                <p  class="arabic">إِنَّآ أَنزَلْنَـٰهُ قُرْءَٰنًا عَرَبِيًّۭا لَّعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ
                                                    ٢</p>

                                                <p>“Indeed, I revealed it as an Arabic Qurʾān” (Q. 12:2)</p>

                                                <p>The implication is clear that Arabic was chosen for its capacity to
                                                    carry the divine message (Suleiman, 2003). Moreover, the Arabic
                                                    language has significantly shaped Islamic theology, law, and
                                                    culture. Qurʾānic Arabic became the standard for eloquence (fasāḥa)
                                                    and correctness (ṣaḥīḥa) in the Arabic language, significantly
                                                    influencing Arabic grammar, lexicography, rhetoric, and literary
                                                    aesthetics (Versteegh, 2001).</p>

                                                <p>However, the importance of the languages of revelation doesn’t entail
                                                    that understanding divine messages is exclusive to those who master
                                                    these languages. The scriptures’ translations and exegesis (tafsīr)
                                                    have made them accessible to diverse linguistic communities
                                                    worldwide. Yet, scholars agree that translations, while helpful, are
                                                    interpretive renditions and cannot fully capture the linguistic and
                                                    literary nuances of the original texts (Ernst, 2003).</p>

                                                <p>Changes and adaptations in divine texts have long been a focal point
                                                    of academic and theological debate. While Islam acknowledges the
                                                    original divine source of all Abrahamic scriptures, it
                                                    simultaneously posits a theory of distortion or alteration (tahrif)
                                                    in these texts, explicitly referring to the Torah and the Injīl
                                                    (Gospel). The Qurʾān, in contrast, is believed to have remained
                                                    unchanged since its revelation to the Prophet Muhammad.</p>

                                                <p>This notion of tahrif doesn’t imply an outright rejection of the
                                                    Torah and Injīl but suggests alterations in the transmitted texts,
                                                    whether through interpretation or transcription over time (Speight,
                                                    2007). The Qurʾān refers to this, albeit indirectly, stating, “So
                                                    woe to those who write the Scripture with their own hands, then say,

                                                <p>Here, Allāh criticises those falsely attributing their writings to
                                                    the divine. Debate surrounds the nature and extent of these alleged
                                                    changes. Some Muslim scholars argue for a partial tahrif, suggesting
                                                    the original divine message has been obscured but not entirely lost.
                                                    Others advocate for a total tahrif, asserting that the divine texts
                                                    were entirely replaced (Rippin, 2005). Modern academic studies,
                                                    however, often approach these texts from a textual criticism
                                                    perspective, acknowledging changes and seeking to understand the
                                                    historical, socio-political, and theological contexts that might
                                                    have influenced these changes (Ehrman, 2005).</p>

                                                <p>The Torah, for instance, has undergone extensive changes and
                                                    adaptations. Documented in various stages of Hebrew, it reflects
                                                    different historical periods and ideologies. The Documentary
                                                    Hypothesis, first proposed by Julius Wellhausen in the 19th century,
                                                    posits that the Torah is a compilation of several sources edited
                                                    together, which might explain some inconsistencies and repetitions
                                                    within the text (Carr, 2013).</p>

                                                <p>As for the Qurʾān, it has been preserved without change since its
                                                    initial revelation. However, non-Muslim scholars have proposed
                                                    theories of its development over time. John Wansbrough, for example,
                                                    suggested the Qurʾān’s evolution over a more extended period than
                                                    traditionally believed, a perspective that has been controversial
                                                    and widely critiqued (Rippin, 2005).</p>

                                                <p>
                                                    “Mankind was one single nation, and Allāh sent Messengers with glad
                                                    tidings and warnings” (Q. 2:213).

                                                <p>
                                                    Here, the Qurʾān acknowledges the universality of the prophetic
                                                    mission, implying a continuity and similarity in the messages
                                                    conveyed by different prophets to their respective communities
                                                    (Brown, 2009). Aside from their duty of prophethood, a noteworthy
                                                    characteristic of these messengers is their human nature. Despite
                                                    their pivotal roles, prophets in Islam are human and not divine.
                                                    They eat, drink, marry, and die, serving as exemplars of ideal human
                                                    conduct rather than transcendent beings beyond human reach (Ali,
                                                    2002). This is affirmed in the Qurʾān when Prophet Muhammad is
                                                    instructed to say:

                                                    and Muḥammad—are known as the ‘ulū al-ʿazm, the prophets of solid
                                                    determination, and are regarded more highly for their steadfastness

                                                    The final and most revered Prophet in Islam is Muhammad, considered
                                                    the ‘Seal of the Prophets’ (khātam al-nabiyyīn). His life (sīrah),

                                                    guidance for We alongside the Qurʾān. The Prophet’s life exemplifies
                                                    a practical application of Qurʾānic principles, providing a tangible

                                                    Furthermore, the role of messengers in Islam also extends to the
                                                    eschatological dimension. In Islamic eschatology, each Prophet will

                                                    Divine intervention and guidance are central to the Islamic
                                                    understanding of the world. It implicates Allāh’s active involvement
                                                    in human lives and the world. At the heart of Islamic belief is the
                                                    conviction in Allāh’s omnipotence and omniscience. The Qurʾān
                                                    consistently attributes all actions and occurrences to the will and
                                                    knowledge of Allāh:

                                                    Him. And He knows what is on the land and in the sea. Not a leaf
                                                    falls but that He knows it” (Q. 6:59).

                                                    This verse emphasises Allāh’s encompassing knowledge of all that
                                                    transpires in the universe, substantiating the belief that nothing
                                                    happens outside His knowledge and will. A complementary principle in
                                                    Islamic thought is that Allāh does not only have foreknowledge of
                                                    all occurrences, but He actively guides and directs them towards a
                                                    predetermined divine plan (Murata & Chittick, 1994).

                                                    The belief in divine guidance, or hidāya, is paramount in Islamic
                                                    thought. According to Islamic theology, guidance emanates solely
                                                    from Allāh and is viewed as His most generous blessing. The Qurʾān
                                                    frequently reiterates this, asserting that Allāh guides whom He
                                                    wills:

                                                    guides whom He wills” (Q. 28:56).

                                                    However, it is essential to note that Islamic scholars have
                                                    differentiated between two types of divine guidance: general
                                                    guidance (al-hidāya al-ʿāmma) and specific guidance (al-hidāya
                                                    al-khāṣṣa). The former is believed to be extended to all creations
                                                    and encompasses the instinctual knowledge bestowed upon animals,
                                                    plants, and inanimate objects to fulfil their purpose in the cosmic
                                                    order. The latter is unique to rational beings and implies guidance
                                                    towards spiritual and moral rectitude (Attas, 1984).

                                                    Divine intervention, or iʿjāz, in Islamic understanding, goes hand
                                                    in hand with the concept of divine guidance. It refers to the
                                                    supernatural interruption of ordinary events to assert divine power
                                                    and guidance. Divine intervention is frequent in the Qurʾān, such as
                                                    the parting of the Red Sea for Moses and his people (Q. 26:63) or
                                                    the protection of Abraham from the fiery furnace (Q. 21:69).

                                                <p>
                                                    Nevertheless, it is vital to clarify that these interventions are
                                                    not violations of natural laws but manifestations of a higher divine
                                                    law operating beyond human comprehension (Leaman, 2006).
                                                    Furthermore, they serve as signs (āyāt) of Allāh’s omnipotence and
                                                    active involvement in the world, substantiating the idea of
                                                    continuous guidance and interaction with His creation.

                                                    Messengers, or rusul, play a central role in Islam, delivering
                                                    divine messages, teaching religious laws, warning of divine wrath,
                                                    and setting ethical examples for their communities.

                                                    The first role, the delivery of divine messages, is fundamental to
                                                    understanding the function of messengers. As intermediaries between
                                                    Allāh and human beings, they convey Allāh’s instructions, laws, and
                                                    moral guidance. The Qurʾān itself represents such a divine message
                                                    delivered through the Prophet Muhammad:

                                                    “O Messenger! Proclaim (the Message) which has been sent down to you
                                                    from your Lord…” (Q. 5:67).

                                                <p>
                                                    The reception and delivery of these divine messages often served to
                                                    establish and validate their prophethood (Afsaruddin, 2014). Closely
                                                    linked to this role is the duty of teaching religious precepts. As

                                                    This verse explicitly outlines the Messenger’s duty to impart
                                                    knowledge of the Qurʾān and the wisdom it contains, a role which
                                                    extends to teaching ritual practices such as prayer and fasting
                                                    (Esposito, 2011). The warning of divine wrath represents another
                                                    crucial task of the messengers. They alert their communities to the
                                                    consequences of disbelief and moral failure, as seen in the
                                                    narratives of Noah, Lot, and Hud in the Qurʾān (Q. 7:59-72).
                                                    However, their warnings are punitive and aimed at encouraging
                                                    repentance and moral rectitude (AlBayhaqi, 2002).

                                                    Lastly, messengers are seen as moral exemplars, their lives
                                                    representing ‘the best pattern of conduct’ for We to emulate

                                                    The hadith literature provides extensive accounts of the Prophet
                                                    Muhammad’s character, habits, and actions, indicating the importance
                                                    of this role (Al-Bukhari, 870). However, despite the commonality of
                                                    these roles, it is essential to note the variety among the
                                                    messengers in their missions and the communities they were sent to.
                                                    While some messengers, like Moses and Muhammad, were sent with
                                                    comprehensive legal codes (shari’a), others, like Jesus, were sent
                                                    to affirm existing laws and bring spiritual renewal (Q. 3:50).

                                                    The Islamic doctrine of predestination, or al-qadr, encapsulates the
                                                    belief in divine decree and divine knowledge, positing that all
                                                    events, actions, and outcomes are predetermined and known by Allāh.
                                                    It represents one of the six articles of īmān and is a fundamental
                                                    component of Islamic theology, warranting careful consideration and

                                                    Al-Badr is based on two intertwined concepts: Allāh’s omniscience,
                                                    knowing everything past, present, and future, and His omnipotence,
                                                    whereby He has power over everything. These notions are well

                                                    and His foreknowledge of all occurrences (Farah, 2003). However,
                                                    understanding predestination in Islam requires balancing these
                                                    concepts with the belief in human free will. On the one hand, Allāh
                                                    decrees and knows all events. On the other hand, He has endowed
                                                    humans with the ability to make choices, rendering them morally
                                                    accountable for their actions: “Whoever does a wrong will be
                                                    recompensed for it…” (Q. 4:111). This verse stresses the
                                                    significance of human action in Islam’s ethical and moral structure

                                                    Several scholars have attempted to reconcile these seemingly
                                                    contradictory principles. AlAsh’ari (d.935), a key figure in
                                                    traditional Sunni theology, argued that while humans perform
                                                    actions, the ability to act is created and given by Allāh, thereby
                                                    preserving both divine power and human responsibility (Hoover,
                                                    2012). Conversely, the Mutazilites, known for their rationalist
                                                    approach, prioritised human free will to safeguard moral
                                                    accountability, thus diverging from a more determinist
                                                    interpretation of predestination (Murata & Chittick, 1994).

                                                    The discourse on predestination also extends to the issues of divine
                                                    justice and the problem of evil. Scholars like Ibn Qayyim
                                                    al-Jawziyya (d.1350) affirmed divine wisdom behind all occurrences,
                                                    even hardships and calamities, perceiving them as trials and tests
                                                    for believers. However, the challenge of explaining the existence of
                                                    suffering within the framework of divine justice and predestination
                                                    remains an enduring point of theological discussion (Leaman, 2006).

                                                    invokes a pivotal theological debate within Islamic intellectual
                                                    history. It seeks to reconcile the seemingly contradictory
                                                    assertions of Allāh’s all-encompassing foreknowledge and control
                                                    over the universe with the capacity of humans to exercise free will
                                                    and make independent choices.

                                                    This paradox’s heart is the relationship between divine sovereignty
                                                    and human agency. The belief in Allāh’s omnipotence and omniscience
                                                    is foundational to Islamic thought. The Qurʾān affirms,

                                                    all that is in the land and sea. No leaf falls without His
                                                    knowledge, nor is there a single grain in the darkness of the earth,

                                                    all phenomena, reinforcing the concept of predestination (Winter,

                                                    predicated on the belief in human free will. The Qurʾān notes,

                                                    Here, the Qurʾān emphasises personal responsibility for actions,
                                                    implying the existence of free will. Therefore, understanding these
                                                    two seemingly contradictory principles is critical to interpreting
                                                    the paradox of predestination and free will (Cf. Leaman, 2006). This
                                                    paradox instigated profound theological discourses within the
                                                    Islamic tradition. The Sunni orthodoxy, represented by the
                                                    Ash’arites, proposed a model of ‘acquisition’ (kasb), suggesting
                                                    that while humans are Allāh creates the actors, their ability to
                                                    act. This theory preserves divine omnipotence and human free will,
                                                    providing a syncretic solution to the paradox (Frank, 1994).

                                                    On the other hand, the Mu’tazilites, associated with rationalistic
                                                    theology, defended the doctrine of free will (tawallud) more
                                                    assertively. They maintained that humans must be free to choose
                                                    their actions to sustain moral responsibility. Thus, they seemed to
                                                    subordinate Allāh’s omnipotence to human free will, an argument
                                                    often criticised for undermining divine sovereignty (van Ess, 2006).

                                                    views. They argued that Allāh creates all actions, but humans have
                                                    the ‘capacity’ (istitā’a) to act, thereby concurrently affirming
                                                    divine omnipotence and human free will (Burrell, 1986).

                                                    The concept of predestination, or al-qadr, carries profound
                                                    theological implications that intersect with ethics, spirituality,
                                                    and social attitudes. A nuanced understanding of al-qadr is vital
                                                    because it shapes our perspectives in many areas.

                                                <p>
                                                    Firstly, al-qadr has implications for ethics and morality. The
                                                    belief that Allāh foreordains everything can be misinterpreted to
                                                    absolve individuals of personal responsibility, thereby undermining
                                                    the essence of moral culpability. However, Islamic tradition
                                                    vehemently rejects fatalistic attitudes. The Qurʾān states,

                                                </p>

                                                    ” No burdened soul will bear the burden of another: even if a
                                                    heavily laden soul should cry for help, none of its load will be
                                                    carried, not even by a close relative. But you [Prophet] can only
                                                    warn those who fear their Lord, though they cannot see Him, and keep
                                                    up the prayerwhoever purifies himself does so for his benefit––
                                                    everything returns to God.” (Q. 35:18).
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    This reinforces the notion that individuals are responsible for
                                                    their actions, an assertion that maintains the integrity of moral
                                                    responsibility within the Islamic ethical system, despite belief in
                                                    al-qadr (Murata & Chittick, 2009). Secondly, the concept of al-qadr
                                                    is also integral to the spiritual resilience of Us. Belief in divine
                                                    predestination can provide solace during trials and tribulations,
                                                    fostering a sense of peace and acceptance. Despite the vicissitudes
                                                    of life, this trust in Allāh’s wisdom and justice is central to the
                                                    Islamic ethos. The Qurʾān consoles, “No disaster strikes except by
                                                    permission of Allāh. And whoever believes in Allāh – He will guide
                                                    his heart…” (Q. 64:11). The belief in al-qadr thus acts as a
                                                    spiritual anchor, cultivating patience, fortitude, and reliance on
                                                    Allāh in the face of adversity (Yusuf, 2016).
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Furthermore, the doctrine of predestination has societal
                                                    implications, particularly concerning socioeconomic disparities.
                                                    While it could lead to complacency and acceptance of unjust
                                                    structures, Islamic teachings stress that al-qadr should not be used
                                                    as a pretext to overlook social injustices or shirk from making
                                                    efforts to improve societal conditions. The Prophet Muhammad’s life
                                                    exemplifies the active struggle for justice and societal betterment,
                                                    despite the belief in predestination (Moten, 2005).
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Moreover, al-qadr bears theological implications for soteriology,
                                                    the study of salvation. Whether predestination implies that Allāh
                                                    has predestined some individuals to Hell is often questioned. While
                                                    the Qurʾān states that Allāh guides whom He wills and leads astray
                                                    whom He wills (Q. 14:4), Islamic theology emphasises that divine
                                                    guidance is intrinsically linked with an individual’s desire to seek
                                                    truth and goodness. Hence, predestination does not negate the mercy
                                                    and justice of Allāh in matters of salvation (Damad, 2001).

                                                <p>
                                                    Finally, belief in al-qadr helps engender humility and gratitude,
                                                    crucial virtues in Islamic spirituality. Recognising that all
                                                    successes are ultimately a result of Allāh’s will can prevent
                                                    arrogance and instil a sense of gratitude. The Qurʾān reminds us,

                                                    “Nun. By the Pen and what they inscribe” (Q. 68:1).

                                                <p>
                                                    The other reference is Sura Al-Alaq, which says, “Read, and your
                                                    Lord is the Most Generous – Who taught by the pen – Taught man that
                                                    which he knew not” (Q. 96:3-5). These verses highlight the Pen’s
                                                    role in divine instruction, symbolising Allāh’s communication with
                                                    creation and the impartation of knowledge. Islamic tradition
                                                    interprets the Pen as a metaphysical symbol, representing the
                                                    instrument of divine wisdom that inscribes Allāh’s knowledge and
                                                    decrees (Chittick, 1989). It can be seen as a symbolic manifestation
                                                    of Allāh’s attribute al-Kātib (The Writer), indicating the
                                                    comprehensiveness and definiteness of His knowledge (Haleem, 2005).

                                                <p>
                                                    Moreover, the Pen’s association with teaching and learning
                                                    underscores the importance of literacy and education in Islam. This
                                                    is significant in a faith where the first revealed word was ‘Read’
                                                    (Iqra), further reinforcing the emphasis on knowledge acquisition as
                                                    a means of spiritual and societal growth (Halstead, 2004).

                                                    The Preserved Tablet, mentioned in the Qurʾān as, “Rather, it is a
                                                    glorious Qurʾān, [Inscribed] in a Preserved Tablet” (Q. 85:21-22),
                                                    is another potent symbol. It embodies the repository of Allāh’s
                                                    knowledge, containing everything that was, is, and will be. The
                                                    tablet signifies the unchangeable and timeless nature of Allāh’s
                                                    knowledge and will. It symbolises the master blueprint of the
                                                    cosmos, detailing every event, large and small, in the universe
                                                    (Nasr, 1993).
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    The relation between the Pen and the Tablet can signify the
                                                    relationship between the divine command (amr) and the divine
                                                    creation (khalq). The Pen, representing Allāh’s command, inscribes
                                                    upon the Tablet, meaning Allāh’s creation. This reflects the Islamic
                                                    view that the universe, in its every detail, manifests Allāh’s
                                                    knowledge and will (Leaman, 2006).

                                                    Exploring these symbols in the light of Islamic metaphysics can
                                                    illuminate our understanding of key theological concepts. While the
                                                    Pen emphasises the dynamic, creative aspect of the divine, the
                                                    Tablet underscores the eternal, immutable nature of divine
                                                    knowledge. Both symbols highlight the intersection of temporality
                                                    and eternity, change and permanence, in the divine order of
                                                    existence (Murata & Chittick, 2009).

                                                <p>The concept of free will plays a critical role in the broader
                                                    conversation surrounding divine predestination and human agency. Its
                                                    study can offer insightful perspectives on the religion’s
                                                    understanding of moral responsibility, justice, and accountability
                                                    in the Afterlife. The Qurʾān affirms the principle of human free
                                                    will in numerous instances. For example, Surah Al-Insan, states:
                                                </p>
                                                <p  class="arabic">

                                                </p>

                                                    “Indeed, We guided him to the way, be he grateful or ungrateful” (Q.
                                                    76:3).

                                                <p>
                                                    Such verses highlight human beings’ ability to exercise their will,
                                                    thereby making moral choices. However, this affirmation of human
                                                    free will operates within divine omnipotence and omniscience, a
                                                    premise integral to Islamic monotheism. As the Qurʾān notes,

                                                    (Q. 81:29).
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Thus, tension arises between the sovereignty of Allāh and the
                                                    autonomy of human beings, sparking numerous intellectual debates
                                                    across Islamic history (Leaman, 2008). Two dominant positions
                                                    emerged: the Jabariyya, who argued for a deterministic worldview
                                                    negating free will, and the Qadariyya, who advocated for
                                                    libertarianism, attributing absolute free will to humans (Brown,
                                                    2009). Both positions, however, have been viewed as extreme within
                                                    mainstream Islamic theology, which typically advocates for a
                                                    balanced approach (Winter, 2008).

                                                <p>
                                                    Ash’arism, a leading theological school in Sunni Islam, adopts a
                                                    compatibilist position. They introduce the kasb (acquisition)
                                                    concept, arguing that while Allāh creates all actions, humans
                                                    acquire their deeds through intention and choice, ensuring moral
                                                    accountability (Hoover, 2013). Mutazilism, on the other hand,
                                                    advocates for a robust form of free will. They posit that Allāh’s
                                                    justice necessitates that human beings be the authors of their
                                                    actions, aligning more closely with libertarian views (Wolfson,
                                                    1976).

                                                    The Ḥanbalī scholar Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya (d. 1350) synthesised
                                                    these positions in a nuanced understanding of free will. He argued
                                                    that Allāh’s foreknowledge does not necessitate compulsion. Instead,
                                                    he held that while Allāh knows and allows all actions, human beings
                                                    still choose their path. This perspective represents a middle ground
                                                    between deterministic and libertarian extremes.

                                                    Islamic mysticism, or Sufism, also offers unique perspectives. Some
                                                    Sufis, like Rūmī (d. 1273), view free will and predestination as two
                                                    sides of the same coin, reflecting different aspects of human and
                                                    divine realities. In their view, humans have free will within
                                                    earthly existence, but from a divine standpoint, everything unfolds
                                                    according to Allāh’s will (Chittick, 2005).

                                                    The complex interplay between divine predestination and human free
                                                    will is a defining feature of Islamic theology, creating a unique
                                                    balance that shapes the moral landscape and understanding of divine
                                                    justice within the faith. The overarching understanding in
                                                    mainstream Islamic thought is that these two seemingly contradictory
                                                    ideas exist in carefully balanced harmony

                                                <p>
                                                    This balance is underpinned by two core Islamic beliefs: the
                                                    omnipotence and omniscience of Allāh and the moral responsibility of
                                                    human beings. These dual beliefs create a space where divine
                                                    predestination and human free will coexist (Leaman, 2008). The

                                                    Ash’arites introduce the notion of kasb (acquisition), asserting

                                                    through their intentions and choices, thus retaining moral

                                                    The Ash’arite position provides an intricate balance between
                                                    acknowledging Allāh’s sovereignty and maintaining human
                                                    responsibility. It is a concept central to understanding why, within
                                                    Islamic belief, individuals are accountable on the Day of Judgement
                                                    for their actions, despite those actions being known to and allowed

                                                    further nuanced insight. He maintained that Allāh’s foreknowledge of
                                                    our choices does not necessitate compulsion, thereby preserving the

                                                    The Sufi tradition offers a different perspective on this balance,
                                                    viewing predestination and free will as reflections of human and
                                                    divine realities. For Sufis, humans possess free will within earthly
                                                    existence, yet from the divine perspective, all events unfold
                                                    according to Allāh’s will (Chittick, 2005).

                                                <p>
                                                    Thus, the balance between divine predestination and human free will
                                                    within Islamic theology is a testament to the nuanced nature of its
                                                    moral and metaphysical landscape. The Qurʾān and the Prophet
                                                    Muḥammad’s teachings affirm this delicate balance, ensuring that
                                                    individuals are morally accountable while acknowledging that Allāh
                                                    is the ultimate arbiter of all affairs. This balance provides
                                                    justice, upholds the significance of human choice, and affirms the
                                                    omnipotence and omniscience of Allāh.

                                                    The Islamic doctrine of free will and determinism has profound
                                                    ethical implications, affecting many areas, including
                                                    accountability, justice, morality, and individual responsibility.
                                                    Central to this discussion is the Islamic belief in a day of
                                                    reckoning (Qiyāmah), where individuals will be held accountable for
                                                    their actions (Q. 75:12-15). The doctrine’s ethical dimensions
                                                    emerge from how it mediates between Allāh’s omniscience and human
                                                    autonomy.

                                                    Firstly, understanding free will and determinism in Islam provides
                                                    the basis for moral accountability. The Qurʾān frequently
                                                    underscores that everyone will bear the consequences of their
                                                    actions, stating,

                                                    Allāh’s Forgiveness, he will find Allāh Oft-Forgiving, Most
                                                    Merciful.” (Q. 4:110).

                                                <p>
                                                    Therefore, the ethical consequences of actions are integral to the
                                                    believer’s existential framework, and determinism does not undermine
                                                    this responsibility (Winter, 2008). Simultaneously, the concept of
                                                    divine predestination underscores Allāh’s wisdom and justice are
                                                    perfect, even if human beings do not fully grasp them. It upholds
                                                    the belief that even apparent misfortunes are ultimately part of
                                                    Allāh’s wisdom and contribute to a greater good. This perspective
                                                    encourages patience, gratitude, and trust in divine providence

                                                    Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya, a prominent Ḥanbalī scholar, provides a
                                                    significant perspective on the ethical implications of this
                                                    interplay. He states that Allāh’s foreknowledge does not imply
                                                    compulsion, meaning that while Allāh knows every action a person
                                                    will undertake, each person has free will and is responsible for
                                                    their decisions. This interpretation preserves the individual’s
                                                    moral responsibility, enabling ethics to significantly guide human
                                                    behaviour

                                                    Furthermore, the debate around free will and determinism has shaped
                                                    Islamic legal thought. For instance, the Mālikī school of thought,
                                                    in its legal reasoning, significantly incorporates the individual’s
                                                    capacity for voluntary action (Ikhtiyār), underlining the importance
                                                    of personal responsibility (Khallāf, 2007).

                                                <p>
                                                    The complex interplay between free will and determinism also
                                                    influences the Islamic understanding of repentance (Tawbah). It is
                                                    premised on the notion that an individual is free to sin and seek
                                                    forgiveness from Allāh (Q.39:53). In this sense, the doctrine
                                                    underscores the human ability to change and grow morally, thus
                                                    affecting how We perceive redemption and personal transformation
                                                    (Ceric, 2004).

                                                    The ethical implications of free will and determinism in Islam also
                                                    extend to discussions of evil and suffering. Islamic theology
                                                    maintains that while Allāh permits evil to occur, human beings
                                                    possess free will, hence are responsible for their evil actions.
                                                    This approach provides a nuanced perspective to theodicy, asserting
                                                    that suffering can lead to spiritual growth and moral betterment
                                                    (Abū Zayd, 2006).

                                                    In Islamic eschatology, the concepts of heaven (Jannah) and hell
                                                    (Jahannam) are cornerstones of the Afterlife (Akhirah), each
                                                    embodying different outcomes of divine judgement. These concepts not
                                                    only offer profound insights into the Islamic ethical worldview but
                                                    also serve as motivation for virtuous living and deterrents from
                                                    immorality (Cook, 2010).

                                                    Jannah, often translated as ‘paradise’, is described in the Qurʾān
                                                    as a reward for those who live righteously and believe in Allāh:
                                                    “Indeed the righteous will be in a secure place; Within gardens and
                                                    springs, wearing [garments] of fine silk and brocade, facing each

                                                    large, [beautiful] eyes” (Q. 44:51-54). This illustrates an image of
                                                    physical, spiritual, and emotional satisfaction, underlining a state

                                                    Descriptions of Jannah often include gardens beneath which rivers

                                                    environment of beauty and luxury. These depictions motivate
                                                    individuals to lead righteous lives (Leaman, 2006).

                                                    abode of punishment for the disbelievers and evildoers: “Surely, the
                                                    disbelievers will be in the torment of Hell to abide therein
                                                    forever. (The torment) will not be lightened for them, and they will
                                                    be plunged into destruction with deep regrets, sorrows, and despair
                                                    therein” (Q. 43:74-75). Jahannam is depicted as a place of immense
                                                    physical and emotional suffering, emphasising a sense of loss,
                                                    regret, and despair (Rippin, 2001).

                                                    Images of Jahannam often include fire (Q. 4:56), chains, and
                                                    shackles (Q. 73:12), symbolic of torment and restraint. These vivid
                                                    depictions are a powerful deterrent for wrongdoing, encouraging
                                                    individuals to shun sinful behaviour (Murata & Chittick, 1994).

                                                    Beyond the literal interpretations, scholars like Ghazālī in his
                                                    “Iḥyāʾ ʿUlūm al-Dīn” (Revival of the Religious Sciences) have also
                                                    offered allegorical interpretations of Jannah and Jahannam. Ghazālī
                                                    suggested that the joys of Jannah and the sufferings of Jahannam
                                                    might be not only physical but also spiritual or psychological
                                                    (Ghazālī & Nabulsi, 2009).

                                                    The concepts of Jannah and Jahannam also carry important ethical
                                                    implications. They promote moral accountability by asserting that
                                                    every action, whether good or evil, has consequences in the Akhirah
                                                    (Q. 99:7-8). This belief encourages the cultivation of virtues such
                                                    as truthfulness, generosity, and patience and avoids vices such as
                                                    dishonesty, greed, and cruelty (Dammen McAuliffe, 2005).

                                                    The end times, also known as eschatology, is a central theme in
                                                    Islamic thought, entwined with moral, ethical, and theological
                                                    implications. Its encompassing aspects include the belief in the Day
                                                    of Judgement (Yawm al-Qiyāmah), resurrection (Ba’th), paradise
                                                    (Jannah), hell (Jahannam), and the appearance of figures like the
                                                    Mahdi, the Dajjal, and the return of Jesus (Brown, 2017). In Islamic
                                                    teachings, the end times are described vividly:

                                                    Such descriptions remind humanity of the transitory nature of
                                                    worldly existence and the ultimate reality of divine judgement, thus
                                                    promoting the cultivation of a virtuous life. The concept of the Day
                                                    of Judgement is fundamental in Islamic eschatology. This day
                                                    represents the time when all beings will be held accountable for
                                                    their actions: “So whosoever does good equal to the weight of an
                                                    atom (or a small ant), shall see it. And whosoever does evil equal
                                                    to the weight of an atom (or a small ant), shall see it” (Q.
                                                    99:7-8). This fosters a sense of moral responsibility and
                                                    accountability, encouraging believers to act ethically, even in
                                                    seemingly insignificant matters (Winter, 2008).

                                                    Furthermore, the notion of resurrection underscores the importance
                                                    of spiritual preparation. It highlights the belief that life after
                                                    death is a new existence where ultimate justice will be served. This

                                                    wrongdoers, enhancing moral restraint (Ayoub, 1984).

                                                    The figures associated with the end times in Islamic eschatology,
                                                    such as the Mahdi and the Dajjal, also carry significant
                                                    implications. The Mahdi, for instance, symbolises the ultimate
                                                    victory of truth and justice, fostering hope and inspiring Us to
                                                    strive for societal justice. The Dajjal, as an embodiment of
                                                    deception and falsehood, serves as a reminder of the continual
                                                    struggle against evil and corruption (Furnish, 2005).

                                                    The return of Jesus (ʿĪsā) is a distinct belief in Islamic
                                                    eschatology. His second coming is often associated with restoring
                                                    peace and eradicating injustice, imbuing We with the resolve to
                                                    stand against oppression and promote peace (Khalidi, 2001).

                                                <p>
                                                    The implications of eschatological beliefs also extend to community
                                                    and societal levels. Faith in the end times can foster unity and
                                                    collective action among We, encouraging them to work towards
                                                    creating just societies and standing against oppression.
                                                    Additionally, these beliefs can provide a theological framework that
                                                    helps individuals make sense of societal and global events,
                                                    potentially reducing anxiety and providing a sense of direction
                                                    (Lawson, 2009).

                                                    However, it is crucial to note that while belief in the end times is
                                                    an integral part of the Islamic faith, these beliefs should not lead
                                                    to fatalism or neglect of worldly responsibilities. As noted by
                                                    classical scholar al-Ghazālī, the belief in the afterlife should
                                                    inspire active engagement in the world to improve oneself and
                                                    society (Ghazālī & Nabulsi, 2009).

                                                    In the Islamic conceptual framework, resolution, completion, and
                                                    intentionality form a triad of significant themes that permeate many
                                                    aspects of faith and practice. These themes are manifest in beliefs,
                                                    ethics, and the spiritual journey of a Muslim, offering a profound
                                                    understanding of human nature and the divine purpose.

                                                    Resolution (al-ʿAzīmah) is a central theme in pursuing personal
                                                    development and moral integrity in Islamic thought. The Qurʾān
                                                    presents numerous instances that highlight the importance of
                                                    resolution. For instance, it mentions Prophet Abraham’s (Ibrāhīm)
                                                    unwavering resolution:

                                                    commands, which he fulfilled. He (Allah) said (to him), ‘Indeed, I
                                                    will make you a leader for the people.’ (Ibrāhīm) said, ‘And of my
                                                    offspring (to make leaders).’ (Allah) said, ‘My Covenant
                                                    (Prophethood) does not include wrongdoers'” (Q. 2:124).
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    This verse illustrates the relationship between resolution and
                                                    divine favour, underscoring the significance of steadfastness and
                                                    commitment in one’s faith journey (Al-Raysuni, 2013). The theme of
                                                    completion (al-Kamāl) speaks to the notion of spiritual and moral
                                                    perfection, a goal that We aspire to reach. The Qurʾān provides a
                                                    model of completion in the character of Prophet Muhammad:
                                                </p>
                                                <p  class="arabic">
                                                    وَإِنَّكَ لَعَلَىٰ خُلُقٍ عَظِيمٍۢ ٤
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    “Indeed, you (O Muhammad) are on an exalted standard of character”
                                                    (Q. 68:4).
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    The Prophet’s life and conduct encapsulate the notion of completion
                                                    and serve as an ideal for We to emulate in their quest for moral and
                                                    spiritual fulfilment (Esack, 1997). Intentionality (an-Niyyah) is
                                                    integral to Islamic practice, shaping how We approach their faith.
                                                    According to a well-known ḥadīth, “Verily actions are by intentions,
                                                    and for every person is what he intended” (Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī 54).
                                                    This highlights intentionality’s pivotal role in determining
                                                    actions’ moral and spiritual value. Intentionality underlines the
                                                    primacy of the heart and mind, reaffirming the holistic nature of
                                                    Islamic spirituality, which encompasses both inner conviction and
                                                    external action (Lombard, 2016).
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    The interplay of these three themes—resolution, completion, and
                                                    intentionality—is evident in the broader narrative of Islamic
                                                    spirituality. Resolution instigates the spiritual journey, fostering
                                                    determination to seek divine proximity. Completion represents the
                                                    ultimate objective, the spiritual and ethical ideal that a Muslim
                                                    strives to attain. Meanwhile, intentionality shapes the path towards
                                                    this goal, infusing actions with profound meaning and direction.

                                                    In the context of ethics, these themes encourage responsibility,
                                                    sincerity, and the pursuit of excellence. They promote the
                                                    cultivation of virtues such as patience, perseverance, honesty, and
                                                    humility, all essential for the growth and development of a morally
                                                    upright individual (Ramadan, 2004).

                                                    Moreover, these themes also have societal implications. Resolution
                                                    can foster community resilience and determination, encouraging
                                                    collective efforts to promote justice and welfare. Completion can
                                                    serve as a standard for societal conduct, instilling a sense of
                                                    responsibility towards achieving communal harmony and justice.
                                                    Intentionality, conversely, can help cultivate sincerity and
                                                    goodwill in societal interactions, promoting social cohesion and
                                                    trust (Sachedina, 2009).

                                                    been a central theme in this paper. We have dissected the role of
                                                    the Pen and the Tablet and evaluated the ethical implications of
                                                    free will and determinism, with particular attention to their
                                                    effects on the concepts of heaven, Hell, and the end times.

                                                    The themes of resolution, completion, and intentionality have been
                                                    thoroughly studied, underlining their vital role in Islamic
                                                    theological constructs. This holistic overview of the numerous
                                                    aspects of Islamic theology has underscored this faith tradition’s
                                                    profound depth and breadth.

                                                    Investigation into the nature and ranks of angels, focusing on
                                                    Gabriel, Michael, Raphael, and Azrael, highlighted their roles in
                                                    Islamic theology. Gabriel’s role as a divine messenger, Michael’s as
                                                    a provider, Raphael’s as a healer, and Azrael’s as an angel of death
                                                    offer diverse ways angels interact within human and divine realms

                                                    We also found that the identities of Beelzebul and Azazel need to be
                                                    clarified, with varying interpretations across different Islamic
                                                    schools of thought. Their roles, however, underscore a spiritual
                                                    struggle between good and evil forces in the world (Lane, 1984).

                                                    The exploration of human-angel-jinn interaction provided rich
                                                    insight into the complex web of relationships within the
                                                    metaphysical world of Islam. Although mysterious, we learned these
                                                    relationships are integral to understanding Islamic cosmology

                                                    Further, our exploration of the divine books illuminated the
                                                    Qurʾān’s central position in Islam, its revelations in Arabic, and
                                                    its preservation over time. We also addressed claims of alterations
                                                    in these texts, concluding that the divine origin and preservation
                                                    of the Qurʾān are fundamental Islamic beliefs (Neal Robinson, 2003).

                                                    Examining the role of messengers in Islam highlighted the
                                                    significance of prophets in conveying divine revelations, teaching
                                                    Islamic principles, and warning humanity of divine retribution.
                                                    Their functions are crucial in understanding the delivery and
                                                    dissemination of divine guidance (Brown, 2009).

                                                    Our exploration of predestination and free will in Islam underlined
                                                    a delicate balance. It was concluded that while God’s knowledge
                                                    encompasses all events, human beings are granted the ability to make
                                                    choices (Jackson, 2002).

                                                    Finally, our exploration of themes of resolution, completion, and
                                                    intentionality highlighted their significance in shaping Islamic
                                                    ethics, societal norms, and spiritual journeys. They underpin many
                                                    aspects of Muslim life, shaping personal development, moral

                                                    In the rich and vibrant landscape of Islamic theology, a captivating
                                                    exploration of the multifaceted aspects of belief and conviction
                                                    unfolds. Delving into the profound and revered concept of Arkān
                                                    al-Īmān, the Pillars of Faith in Islam, intricately shapes the

                                                    These six fundamental beliefs act as a beacon of solace, certainty,

                                                    At the heart of these pillars stands the unwavering belief in Allāh,
                                                    the omnipotent Creator and Nurturer of the universe, embodying an
                                                    absolute and timeless divinity. Illuminating the teachings of the
                                                    Holy Qur’an, the quintessence of His divine singularity is captured,
                                                    accentuating the oneness of Allāh. “He is Allah, [who is] One,

                                                    Gospel to the Psalms, the Qur’an is underscored as the ultimate

                                                    Navigating through the concept of the Day of Judgment, a pivotal
                                                    moment of accountability is highlighted. Every soul is depicted as

                                                    their destiny intricately linked to their actions. Divine justice
                                                    and the impact of one’s choices are contemplated, urging believers

                                                    explored, acknowledging Allāh’s omniscience and omnipotence while
                                                    underscoring human agency and accountability. This belief presents a
                                                    delicate interplay between divine decree and human free will,

                                                    sincerity and hypocrisy, is delved into, exploring the complexities
